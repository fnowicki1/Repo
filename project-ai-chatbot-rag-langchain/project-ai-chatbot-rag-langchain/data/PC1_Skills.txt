CHAPTER 4:
SKILLS
While your character’s attributes represent their raw talent and potential, skills represent
their training and experience at performing certain tasks. Each skill is keyed to one of your
character’s attributes and used for an array of related actions. Your character’s expertise in
a skill comes from several sources, including their background and class. In this chapter,
you’ll learn about skills, their scope, and the actions they can be used for.
A character’s acumen in skills can come from all sorts
of training, from practicing acrobatic tricks to studying
academic topics to rehearsing a performing art. When
you create your character and as they advance in level,
you have flexibility as to which skills they become better
at and when. Some classes depend heavily on certain
skills—such as the bard’s reliance on Performance—but
for most classes, you can choose whichever skills make
the most sense for your character’s theme and backstory
at 1st level, then use their adventure and downtime
experiences to inform how their skills should improve as
your character levels up.
A character gains training in certain skills at 1st level:
typically two from their background, a small number
of predetermined skills from their class, and several
skills of your choice granted by their class. This training
increases your proficiency ranks for those skills to
trained instead of untrained and lets you use more of
the skills’ actions. Sometimes you might become trained
in the same skill from multiple sources, such as if your
background granted training in Survival and you took
the ranger class, which also grants training in Survival.
Each time after the first that you’d become trained in a
given skill, you instead allocate the trained proficiency
to any other skill of your choice—though if the skill is a
Lore skill, the new skill must also be a Lore skill.
Key Attribute
Each skill is tied to a key attribute. You add your modifier
for this attribute to checks and DCs when using that
skill. For example, skulking about the shadows of a
city at night with Stealth uses your Dexterity modifier,
navigating the myriad personalities and power plays of
court politics with Society uses your Intelligence modifier,
and so on. The key attribute for each skill is listed on the
Skills, Key Attributes, and Actions table on page 227 and
also appears in parentheses following the skill’s name in
the descriptions on the following pages. If the GM deems
it appropriate for a certain situation, however, they might
have you use a different attribute modifier for a skill
check or when determining your skill DC.
Skill Actions
The actions you can perform with a given skill are sorted
into those you can use untrained and those that require

you to be trained in the skill, as shown on the Skills, Key
Attributes, and Actions table (page 227). The untrained
and trained actions of each skill appear in separate
sections within the skill’s description.
Anyone can use a skill’s untrained actions, but you
can use trained actions only if you have a proficiency
rank of trained or better in that skill. A circumstance,
condition, or effect might bar you from a skill action
regardless of your proficiency rank, and sometimes
using a skill in a specific situation might require you
to have a higher proficiency rank than what is listed
on the table. For instance, even though a fighter
untrained in Arcana could identify a construct with a
lucky roll using Arcana to Recall Knowledge, the GM
might decide that Recalling Knowledge to determine
the spells used to create such a construct is beyond the
scope of the fighter’s anecdotal knowledge. The GM
decides whether a task requires a particular proficiency
rank.
IMPROVING SKILLS

As your character advances in level, there are two main
ways their skills improve: skill increases and skill feats.
Your class lists the levels at which you gain each of these
improvements.

Skill Increases

Skill increases improve your proficiency in skills of your
choice. You can use these increases to become trained
in new skills or increase your proficiency rank in skills
you’re trained in (from trained to expert at any level,
expert to master at 7th level or higher, and master to
legendary at 15th level or higher). Unlike when you first
become trained at a skill, if two different abilities would
make you an expert, master, or legendary in a skill, you
don’t get to choose a second skill to become expert in—
the redundant benefit simply has no effect.
Skill Feats

Skill feats are a type of general feat that often grant you a
new way to use a skill or make you better at using a skill
in a particular way. Skill feats always have the skill trait.
These feats appear in Chapter 5.
Skill Checks and DCs
When you’re actively using a skill, often by performing
one of its actions, you might attempt a skill check: rolling
a d20 and adding your skill modifier. To determine this
modifier, add your attribute modifier for the skill’s key
attribute, your proficiency bonus for the skill, and any
other bonuses and penalties.
Skill modifier = skill’s key attribute modifier +
proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
When noting the modifier on your character sheet, you
should write down only the numbers that always apply—
typically just your attribute modifier and proficiency bonus
at 1st level. At higher levels, you may wear or use items to
improve your skills with item bonuses pretty much all the
time; you should include those in your calculation, too.

The GM sets the DC of a skill check, using the
guidelines in Chapter 10: Game Mastering. The DCs
you’re most likely to encounter frequently are the five
simple skill DCs below, which are presented here to
give you a sense of what number you’ll need to roll to
succeed at most tasks.
Task Difficulty Simple DC
Untrained 10
Trained 15
Expert 20
Master 30
Legendary 40
When someone or something tests your skill, they
attempt a check against your skill DC, which is equal
to 10 plus your skill modifier. A skill DC works like
any other DC to determine the effect of an opposing
creature’s skill action.
See page 400 in Chapter 8: Playing the Game for more
information about modifiers, bonuses, and penalties.
Armor and Skills
Some armor imposes a penalty on specific skill
checks and DCs. If a creature is wearing armor
that imparts a skill penalty, that penalty is
applied to the creature’s Strength- and
Dexterity-based skill checks and skill DCs,
unless the action has the attack trait. Check
penalties from armor are detailed on page
274 in Chapter 6: Equipment.
Secret Checks
Sometimes you won’t know whether you have
succeeded at a skill check. If an action has the secret
trait, the GM rolls the check for you and informs you
of the effect without revealing the result of the roll or
the degree of success. The GM rolls secret checks when
your knowledge about the outcome is imperfect, like
when you’re searching for a hidden creature or object,
attempting to deceive someone, translating a tricky bit
of ancient text, or remembering some piece of lore.
This way, you as the player don’t know things that
your character wouldn’t. This rule is the default for
actions with the secret trait, but the GM can choose
not to use secret checks if they would rather some or
all rolls be public.
Exploration and Downtime Activities
Some skill activities have the exploration or downtime
trait. Exploration activities usually take a minute or
more, while downtime activities may take a day or more.
They usually can’t be used during an encounter, though
the GM might bend this restriction. If you’re not sure
whether you have the time to use one of these activities,
ask your GM.

Decipher Writing (Trained)
Skills: Arcana, Occultism, Religion, Society
When you encounter particularly archaic or esoteric
texts, the GM might require you to Decipher the Writing
before you can understand it. You must be trained in the
relevant skill to Decipher Writing.
The skills used for Deciphering Writing and the types
of texts they usually decipher are:
• Arcana for writing about magic or science
• Occultism for esoteric texts about mysteries and
philosophy
• Religion for scripture
• Society for coded messages or archaic documents.
DECIPHER WRITING
CONCENTRATE EXPLORATION SECRET
You attempt to decipher complicated writing or literature on an
obscure topic. This usually takes 1 minute per page of text, but
might take longer (typically an hour per page for decrypting
ciphers or the like). The text must be in a language you can
read, though the GM might allow you to attempt to decipher
text written in an unfamiliar language using Society instead.
The DC is determined by the GM based on the state or
complexity of the document. The GM might have you roll one
check for a short text or a check for each section of a larger
text.
Critical Success You understand the true meaning of the text.
Success You understand the true meaning of the text. If it
was a coded document, you know the general meaning but
might not have a word-for-word translation.
Failure You can’t understand the text and take a –2
circumstance penalty to further checks to decipher it.
Critical Failure You believe you understand the text on that
page, but you have in fact misconstrued its message.
Sample Decipher Tasks
Trained entry-level philosophy treatise
Expert complex code, such as a cipher
Master spymaster’s code or advanced research notes
Legendary esoteric planar text written in metaphor by
an ancient celestial
General skill actions are skill actions that can be used with multiple different skills. When
you use a general skill action, you might use your modifier from any skill that lists it as one
of the skill’s actions, depending on the situation.

GENERAL SKILL ACTIONS

Earn Income (Trained)
Skills: Crafting, Lore, Performance, others
You can use a skill to earn money during downtime. You
must be trained in the skill to do so. This takes time to
set up, and your income depends on your proficiency
rank and how lucrative a task you can find. Because
this process requires a significant amount of time
and involves tracking things outside the progress of
adventures, it won’t come up in every campaign.
The most typical ways to Earn Income, detailed
further in this section are:
• Crafting goods for the market (Crafting)
• Practicing a Trade (Lore)
• Staging a Performance (Performance)
In some cases, the GM might let you use a different
skill to Earn Income through specialized work. Usually,
this is scholarly work, such as using Religion in a
monastery to study old texts—but giving sermons at
a church would still fall under Performance instead of
Religion. You also might be able to use physical skills to
make money, such as using Acrobatics to perform feats
in a circus or Thievery to pick pockets. If you’re using a
skill other than Crafting, Lore, or Performance, the DC
tends to be significantly higher.
EARN INCOME
DOWNTIME
You use one of your skills to make money during downtime.
The GM assigns a task level representing the most lucrative
job available. You can search for lower-level tasks, with the
GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can
attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though
this takes time and requires using the Diplomacy skill to
Gather Information, doing some research, or socializing.
When you take on a job, the GM secretly sets the DC of your
skill check. After your first day of work, you roll to determine
your earnings. You gain an amount of income based on your
result, the task’s level, and your proficiency rank (as listed on
the Income Earned table).
You can continue working at the task on subsequent days
without needing to roll again. For each day you spend after the
first, you earn the same amount as the first day, up until the
task’s completion. The GM determines how long you can work
at the task. Most tasks last a week or two, though some can
take months or even years.
Critical Success You do outstanding work. Gain the amount of
currency listed for the task level + 1 and your proficiency
rank.
INCOME EXAMPLES

The following examples show the kinds of tasks your character might take on to Earn Income during low-level and high-level play.
Harsk Makes Tea

Harsk is a 3rd-level ranger and an expert at harvesting and
brewing tea. He has a Tea Lore modifier of +7.
He has 30 days of downtime at his disposal and
decides to work at a prestigious local tea house. The GM
decides this is a 5th-level task if Harsk wants to assist
the tea master, or a 2nd-level task if he wants to serve
tea. Harsk chooses the tougher task, and the GM secretly
sets the DC at 20.
Harsk rolls a 4 on his Tea Lore check for a result of 11.
Poor Harsk has failed! He earns only 2 sp for his efforts and
continues working for 3 more days, for a total of 8 sp.
At that point, the GM offers Harsk a choice: either he
can finish out the week with the tea master and look for
a new job, or he can lower his ambitions and serve in the
tea house. Harsk, now more aware of his own capabilities,
accepts the less prestigious job for now. He moves to his
new job and attempts a new Tea Lore check against DC 16.
Rolling a 19, he gets a result of 26—a critical success! He
earns 5 sp per day (like a success at a 3rd-level task).
The GM rules that demand will be high enough that Harsk
can work there for the remainder of his downtime if he so
chooses, a total of 26 days. Harsk accepts and earns a total
of 138 sp (13 gp, 8 sp) that month.

Lem Performs

Lem is a 16th-level bard and legendary in Performance, and
he has a magical flute that grants him an item bonus on
Performance checks. He has a Performance modifier of +31
when playing his magical flute.
With 30 days of downtime ahead of him, Lem wonders
if he can find something that might excite him more than
performing in front of a bunch of stuffy nobles. He finds
a momentous offer indeed—a performance in a celestial
realm, and Lem’s patron goddess Shelyn might even be in
attendance! This is a 20th-level task, and the GM secretly
sets the DC at 40.
Lem rolls an 11 on his Performance check for a result of
42. Success! The engagement lasts for a week, and at the
end, the grateful celestials present Lem with a beautiful
living diamond rose in constant bloom worth 1,400 gold
pieces (200 gp per day for 7 days).
With 23 days of downtime left, Lem accepts a 14th-level
task performing at a prestigious bardic college for members
of a royal court. The GM secretly sets the DC at 32, and
Lem critically succeeds, earning 28 gp per day for a total
of 644 gp. Between the two performances, Lem has earned
just over 2,000 gold pieces during his downtime—though
he’s not sure he’ll ever sell that rose.
Success You do competent work. Gain the amount of currency
listed for the task level and your proficiency rank.
Failure You do shoddy work and get paid the bare minimum
for your time. Gain the amount of currency listed in the
failure column for the task level. The GM will likely reduce
how long you can continue at the task.
Critical Failure You earn nothing for your work and are fired
immediately. You can’t continue at the task. Your reputation
suffers, potentially making it difficult for you to find
rewarding jobs in that community in the future.
Sample Earn Income Tasks
These examples use Alcohol Lore to work in a bar or
Legal Lore to perform legal work.
Trained bartend, do legal research
Expert curate drink selection, present minor court cases
Master run a large brewery, present important court
cases
Legendary run an international brewing franchise,
present a case in Hell’s courts
Crafting Goods for the Market (Crafting)
Using Crafting, you can work at producing common
items for the market. It’s usually easy to find work
making basic items whose level is 1 or 2 below your
settlement’s level.

(critical)
EXTRA PREPARATION

When Earning Income, you might be able to spend days of
downtime to prepare for your task and lower the DC of the
skill check. This might involve rehearsing a play, studying a
topic, and so on. The GM determines how long preparation
takes and how much the DC changes. This is most useful
when you’re trying a task that’s higher level than you.
Ending or Interrupting Tasks
When a task you’re doing is complete, or if you stop in
the middle of one, you normally have to find a new task
if you want to keep Earning Income. For instance, if you
quit your job working at the docks, you’ll need to find
another place of employment instead of picking up where
you left off. This usually takes 1 day or more of downtime
looking for leads on new jobs.
However, you might pause a task due to an adventure
or event that wouldn’t prevent you from returning to
the old job later. The GM might decide that you can pick
up where you left off, assuming the task hasn’t been
completed by others in your absence. Whether you roll
a new skill check when you resume is also up to the GM.
Generally speaking, if you had a good initial roll and want
to keep it, you can, but if you had a bad initial roll, you
can’t try for a better one by pausing to do something
else. If your statistics changed during the break—usually
because you leveled up while adventuring—you can
attempt a new check.
Higher-level tasks represent special commissions,
which might require you to Craft a specific item using
the Craft downtime activity and sell it to a buyer at full
Price. These opportunities don’t occur as often and might
have special requirements—or serious consequences if
you disappoint a prominent client.
Practicing a Trade (Lore)
You apply the practical benefits of one of your Lore
specialties during downtime by practicing your trade.
This is most effective for Lore specialties such as
business, law, or sailing, where there’s high demand for
workers. The GM might increase the DC or determine
only low-level tasks are available if you’re attempting to
use an obscure Lore skill to Earn Income. You might also
need specialized tools to accept a job, like mining tools
to work in a mine or a merchant’s scale to buy and sell
valuables in a market.
Staging a Performance (Performance)
You perform for an audience to make money. The
available audiences determine the level of your task,
since more discerning audiences are harder to impress
but provide a bigger payout. The GM determines the
task level based on the audiences available. Performing

for a typical audience of commoners on the street is a
level 0 task, but a performance for a group of artisans
with more refined tastes might be a 2nd- or 3rd-level
task, and ones for merchants, nobility, and royalty are
increasingly higher level.
Your degree of success determines whether you moved
your audience and whether you were rewarded with
applause or rotten fruit.
Identify Magic (Trained)
Skills: Arcana, Nature, Occultism, Religion
Using the skill related to the appropriate tradition, as
explained in Magical Traditions and Skills on page 231,
you can attempt to identify a magical item, location,
or ongoing effect. In many cases, you can use a skill to
attempt to Identify Magic of a tradition other than your
own at a higher DC. The GM determines whether you
can do this and what the DC is.
IDENTIFY MAGIC
CONCENTRATE EXPLORATION SECRET
Once you discover that an item, location, or ongoing effect
is magical, you can spend 10 minutes to try to identify the
particulars of its magic. If your attempt is interrupted, you
must start over. The GM sets the DC for your check. Cursed
magic or esoteric subjects usually have higher DCs or might
even be impossible to identify using this activity alone.
Heightening a spell doesn’t increase the DC to identify it.
Critical Success You learn all the attributes of the magic,
including its name (for an effect), what it does, any means
of activating it (for an item or location), and whether it is
cursed.
Success For an item or location, you get a sense of what it
does and learn any means of activating it. For an ongoing
effect (such as a spell with a duration), you learn the
effect’s name and what it does. You can’t try again in hopes
of getting a critical success.
Failure You fail to identify the magic and can’t try again for
1 day.
Critical Failure You misidentify the magic as something else
of the GM’s choice.
Learn a Spell (Trained)
Skills: Arcana, Nature, Occultism, Religion
If you’re a spellcaster, you can use the skill corresponding
to your magical tradition to learn a new spell of that
tradition. The Learning a Spell table lists the Price of the
materials needed to Learn a Spell of each rank. Learning
a Spell is most useful for classes that use a limited list
of spells, like the bard, witch, or wizard, though other
classes might use it gain rare or uncommon spells.
LEARN A SPELL
CONCENTRATE EXPLORATION
Requirements You have a spellcasting class feature, and the
spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition’s spell list.
You can gain access to a new spell of your tradition from
someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a
spellbook or scroll. If you can cast spells of multiple traditions,
you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions, but you must
use the corresponding skill to do so. For example, if you were
a cleric with the bard multiclass archetype, you couldn’t use
Religion to add an occult spell to your bardic spell repertoire.
To learn the spell, you must do the following:
• Spend 1 hour per spell rank, during which you must
remain in conversation with a person who knows the
spell or have the magical writing in your possession.
• Have materials with the Price indicated in the Learning
a Spell table.
• Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to
your tradition (DC determined by the GM, often close
to the DC on the Learning a Spell Table). Uncommon or
rare spells have higher DCs; full guidelines for the GM
appear on page 52 of GM Core.
Critical Success You expend half the materials and learn the
spell.
Success You expend the materials and learn the spell.
Failure You fail to learn the spell but can try again after you
gain a level. The materials aren’t expended.
Critical Failure As failure, except you expend half the materials.
LEARNING A SPELL
Spell Rank Price Typical DC
1st or cantrip 2 gp 15
2nd 6 gp 18
3rd 16 gp 20
4th 36 gp 23
5th 70 gp 26
6th 140 gp 28
7th 300 gp 31
8th 650 gp 34
9th 1,500 gp 36
10th 7,000 gp 41
Learned Spells
A spell you learn is added to your repository of spells,
such as a spellbook for a wizard, familiar for a witch,
or spell list for a cleric or druid. If you have a spell
repertoire, such as a bard, it’s not automatically added
since you can only know a limited number of spells.
Instead, you can select it when you add or swap spells.
Recall Knowledge (Untrained)
Skills: Arcana, Crafting, Lore, Medicine, Nature,
Occultism, Religion, Society, others
To remember useful information on a topic, you can
attempt to Recall Knowledge. This action is one you’re
likely to use frequently. Learning more about the world
and people around you is one of the best ways to inform
your decisions, and Recalling Knowledge can help you
figure out how to best fight monsters and figure out
puzzles and social challenges.

MAGICAL TRADITIONS AND SKILLS
Each magical tradition has a corresponding skill, as
shown on the table below. You must have the trained
proficiency rank in a skill to use it to Identify Magic or
Learn a Spell. Something without a specific tradition,
such as an item with the magical trait, can be identified
using any of these skills.
Magical Tradition Corresponding Skill
Arcane Arcana
Divine Religion
Occult Occultism
Primal Nature

You might know basic information about something
without needing to attempt a check, but Recall
Knowledge requires you to stop and think for a moment
so you can recollect more specific facts and apply them.
You might even need to spend time investigating first.
For instance, to use Medicine to learn the cause of death,
you might need to conduct a forensic examination before
attempting to Recall Knowledge.
RECALL KNOWLEDGE [one-action]
CONCENTRATE SECRET
You attempt a skill check to try to remember a bit of
knowledge regarding a topic related to that skill. Suggest
which skill you’d like to use and ask the GM one question.
The GM determines the DC. You might need to collaborate
with the GM to narrow down the question or skills, and you
can decide not to Recall Knowledge before committing to the
action if you can’t don’t like your options.
Critical Success You recall the knowledge accurately. The
GM answers your question truthfully and either tells you

additional information or context, or answers one follow-
up question.

Success You recall the knowledge accurately. The GM
answers your question truthfully.
Critical Failure You recall incorrect information. The GM
answers your question falsely (or decides to give you no
information, as on a failure).
Recall Knowledge Tasks
The following examples use Society or Religion.
Untrained name of a ruler, head of state, key noble, or
major deity
Trained line of succession for a major noble family,
core doctrines of a major deity
Expert genealogy of a minor noble, teachings of an
ancient priest
Master hierarchy of a genie noble court, major
extraplanar temples of a deity
Legendary existence of a long-lost noble heir, secret
doctrines of a religion
RECALL KNOWLEDGE SKILLS
The following skills can be used to Recall Knowledge about
the listed topics. Some topics might appear on multiple lists,
but the skills could give different information. For example,
Arcana might tell you about the magical defenses of a
construct, whereas Crafting could tell you about its sturdy
resistance to physical attacks.
• Arcana: Arcane theories, magical traditions, creatures of
arcane significance, and arcane planes.
• Crafting: Alchemical reactions and creatures, item value,
engineering, unusual materials, and constructs.
• Lore: The subject of the Lore skill’s subcategory.
• Medicine: Diseases, poisons, wounds, and forensics.
• Nature: The environment, flora, geography, weather,
creatures of natural origin, and natural planes.
• Occultism: Ancient mysteries, folk superstition, obscure
philosophy, creatures of occult significance, and
esoteric planes.
• Religion: Divine agents, divine planes, theology, obscure
myths, and creatures of religious significance.
• Society: Local history, key personalities, legal institutions,
societal structure, and humanoid culture.
Using an applicable Lore to Recall Knowledge about a topic,
such as Engineering Lore instead of Crafting to find structural
weaknesses in a bridge, typically comes with a lower DC. Your
special interests can pay off! In some cases, you can get the
GM’s permission to use a different but related skill, usually
against a higher DC than normal. The GM might allow checks
to Recall Knowledge using other skills. For example, you might
assess the skill of an acrobat using Acrobatics. If you’re using
a physical skill (like in this example), the GM will most likely
have you use a mental modifier—typically Intelligence—instead
of the skill’s normal physical attribute modifier.

RECALL KNOWLEDGE QUESTIONS
When encountering a subject for the first time, your first
question will likely be a basic “What is it?”, which the GM
can answer with a name and basic description like, “That’s
an ogre, a tough and cruel giant” or “This is the symbol of
Urgathoa, a goddess of disease, gluttony, and undeath.” If
you already know this base level of detail on the subject,
the list below includes some reasonable questions. The GM
determines what other questions to allow. Usually this is
simple as long as you stick to one question. Any question
must be about something observable in the game world, not
the abstract numbers of the rules. The GM might tell you a
lumbering monster’s Reflex save is its weakest—translating
a concept your character could understand using the game
term for clarity—but wouldn’t reveal the exact Reflex modifier.
The GM can find more guidance on page 54 of GM Core.
Creatures: “Can it be reasoned with?” “What environments
does it live in?” “What’s its most notable offensive ability?”
“Is it highly vulnerable or resistant to anything?” “Are any
of its defenses weak?”
Magic: “How can it be avoided?” “What type of people
use this magic?” “How long does it last?”
Organizations: “What kind of influence does it have?”
“Where is it headquartered?” “How large is it?” “What kind
of members does it have?” “Who are its major authorities?”
“Do they have any notable allies and enemies?”
People: “What’s their personality like?” “What do they
look like?” “Do they have any notable talents?” “Do they
have notable allies and enemies?” “What kind of influence
do they have?” “Do they have any vices?”
Sites: “What’s its general location?” “How large is it?”
“What’s the government like?” “Do any notable people live
there?” “What kind of monsters dwell there?” “What’s the
environment and terrain like?”
Subsist (Untrained)
Skills: Society, Survival
If you need to provide food and shelter, you can use the
Subsist downtime activity. This typically uses Society if
you’re in a settlement or Survival if you’re in the wild.
SUBSIST
DOWNTIME
You try to provide food and shelter for yourself, and possibly
others as well, with a standard of living described on page
295. The GM determines the DC based on the nature of
the place where you’re trying to Subsist. You might need a
minimum proficiency rank to Subsist in particularly strange
environments. Unlike most downtime activities, you can
Subsist after 8 hours or less of exploration, but if you do, you
take a –5 penalty.
Critical Success You either provide a subsistence living for
yourself and one additional creature, or you improve your
own food and shelter, granting yourself a comfortable living.

Success You find enough food and shelter with basic protection
from the elements to provide you a subsistence living.
Failure You’re exposed to the elements and don’t get enough
food, becoming fatigued until you attain sufficient food and
shelter.
Critical Failure You attract trouble, eat something you
shouldn’t, or otherwise worsen your situation. You take a
–2 circumstance penalty to checks to Subsist for 1 week.
You don’t find any food at all; if you don’t have any stored
up, you’re in danger of starving or dying of thirst if you
continue failing.
Sample Subsist Tasks
Untrained a lush forest with calm weather or a large city
with plentiful resources
Trained typical hillside or village
Expert typical mountains or insular hamlet
Master typical desert or city under siege
Legendary barren wasteland or city of undead
SKILLS
The following entries describe the skills in the game. The heading for each entry provides
the skill’s name, with that skill’s key attribute in parentheses.
A brief description of the skill is followed by a list of
actions anyone can use, and then the actions you can
perform only if you are trained in that skill. Some actions
list sample tasks for each rank to give you a better
sense of what you can accomplish as your proficiency
increases. As the actions of a skill aren’t comprehensive,
there may be times when the GM asks you to attempt
a skill check without using any of the listed actions, or
times when the GM asks you to roll using a different key
attribute modifier.
Most skills include entries for success and failure, as
well as descriptions of what occurs on a critical success or
a critical failure. If either of the critical entries is absent,
treat those results as a success or failure, as normal.
Acrobatics (Dex)
Acrobatics measures your ability to perform tasks
requiring coordination and grace. When you use
the Escape basic action (page 416), you can use your
Acrobatics modifier instead of your unarmed attack
modifier. You can also use it for the basic actions Arrest
a Fall (page 418) and Grab an Edge (page 418) instead
of Reflex.
BALANCE [one-action]
MOVE
Requirements You are in a square that contains a narrow
surface, uneven ground, or another similar feature.
You move across a narrow surface or uneven ground,
attempting an Acrobatics check against its Balance DC. You
are off-guard while on a narrow surface or uneven ground.
Critical Success You move up to your Speed.
Success You move up to your Speed, treating it as difficult
terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement).
Failure You must remain stationary to keep your balance
(wasting the action) or you fall. If you fall, your turn ends.
Critical Failure You fall and your turn ends.
Sample Balance Tasks
Untrained tangled roots, uneven cobblestones
Trained wooden beam
Expert deep, loose gravel
Master tightrope, smooth sheet of ice
Legendary razor’s edge, chunks of floor falling in midair
TUMBLE THROUGH [one-action]
MOVE
You Stride up to your Speed. During this movement, you
can try to move through the space of one enemy. Attempt
an Acrobatics check against the enemy’s Reflex DC as soon
as you try to enter its space. You can Tumble Through using
Climb, Fly, Swim, or another action instead of Stride in the
appropriate environment.
Success You move through the enemy’s space, treating the
squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs
10 feet of movement). If you don’t have enough Speed to
move all the way through its space, you get the same effect
as a failure.
Failure Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if
you had moved out of the square you started in.
Acrobatics Trained Actions
MANEUVER IN FLIGHT [one-action]
MOVE
Requirements You have a fly Speed.
You try a difficult maneuver while flying. Attempt an Acrobatics
check. The GM determines what maneuvers are possible, but
they rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.
Success You succeed at the maneuver.
Failure Your maneuver fails. The GM chooses if you simply
can’t move or if some other detrimental effect happens.
The outcome should be appropriate for the maneuver you
attempted (for instance, being blown off course if you were
trying to fly against a strong wind).
Critical Failure As failure, but the consequence is more dire.
Sample Maneuver in Flight Tasks
Trained steep ascent or descent
Expert fly against the wind
Master reverse direction
Legendary fly through gale force winds
SQUEEZE
EXPLORATION MOVE
You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you
can barely fit through. This action is for exceptionally small
spaces; many tight spaces are difficult terrain (page 423) that
you can move through more quickly and without a check.
Critical Success You squeeze through the tight space in 1
minute per 10 feet of squeezing.
Success You squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.
Critical Failure You become stuck in the tight space. While
you’re stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another
Acrobatics check at the same DC. Any result on that check
other than a critical failure causes you to become unstuck.
Sample Squeeze Tasks
Trained space barely fitting your shoulders
Master space barely fitting your head
FALLING

When you fall more than 5 feet, you take falling damage
when you land, which is bludgeoning damage equal to
half the distance you fell. If you take any damage from a
fall, you’re knocked prone when you land. You can Grab
an Edge as a reaction (page 418) to reduce or eliminate
the damage from some falls. More detailed rules for
falling damage appear on page 421.
MULTIPLE ATTACKS WITH ATHLETICS
Several Athletics actions have the attack trait, meaning
that using them more than once in the same turn makes
them less accurate. Since these actions use your free
hand, you use the traits for your fist attack to determine
the multiple attack penalty, so your fist’s agile trait
applies. Therefore, you take a –4 penalty if the action is
your second attack of the turn, or a –8 if it’s the third.
Some weapon traits allow you to take these actions
using a weapon, in which case the penalty might be –5
or –10 if the weapon doesn’t have the agile trait. Some
characters can get unarmed attacks without the agile
trait as well. If it’s unclear which penalty to use, the GM
makes the call.
Arcana (Int)
Arcana measures how much you know about arcane
magic and creatures. Even if you’re untrained, you can
Recall Knowledge.
• Recall Knowledge (page 231) about arcane theories;
magic traditions; creatures of arcane significance
(like constructs, beasts, and elementals); and the
Astral Plane, Elemental Planes, and the Netherworld.
Arcana Trained Actions
You must be trained in Arcana to use it for the following
general skill actions.
• Decipher Writing (page 228) about arcane theory.
• Identify Magic (page 230), particularly magic of the
arcane tradition.
• Learn a Spell (page 230) from the arcane tradition.
BORROW AN ARCANE SPELL
CONCENTRATE EXPLORATION
If you’re an arcane spellcaster who prepares spells, you
can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else’s arcane
spellbook, arcane witch familiar, or the like. The GM sets
the DC for the check based on the spell’s rank and rarity; it’s
typically a bit easier than Learning the Spell (page 230).
Success You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal
spell preparation.
Failure You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot remains
available for you to prepare a different spell. You can’t try
to borrow this spell again until the next time you prepare
spells.

Athletics (Str)
Athletics allows you to perform deeds of physical
prowess. Most Athletics actions let you move about the
environment (Climb, High Jump, Long Jump, Swim) or
control your opponent’s movement in combat (Grapple,
Reposition, Shove, Trip, and Disarm).
Escape: When you use the Escape basic action (page
416), you can use your Athletics modifier instead of your
unarmed attack modifier.
CLIMB [one-action]
MOVE
Requirements You have two hands free.
You attempt an Athletics check to move a maximum distance
of 5 feet up, down, or across an incline. You’re off-guard while
climbing unless you have a climb Speed. The GM determines
the DC based on the nature of the incline and environmental
circumstances; you might get an automatic critical success on
an incline that’s trivial to climb. If your land Speed is 40 feet or
higher, increase the maximum distance by 5 feet for every 20
feet of Speed above 20 feet.
Critical Success You move along the incline, increasing the
maximum distance by 5 feet.
Success You move along the incline.
Critical Failure You fall. If you began the climb on stable
ground, you fall and land prone.
Sample Climb Tasks
Untrained ladder, steep slope, low-branched tree
Trained rigging, rope, typical tree
Expert wall with small handholds and footholds
Master ceiling with handholds and footholds, rock wall
Legendary smooth surface
FORCE OPEN [one-action]
ATTACK
Using your body, a lever, or some other tool, you attempt
to forcefully open a door, window, container or heavy gate.
With a high enough result, you can even smash through walls.
Without a crowbar, prying something open takes a –2 item
penalty to the Athletics check to Force Open.
Critical Success You open the door, window, container, or gate
and can avoid damaging it in the process.
Success You break the door, window, container, or gate open,
and it gains the broken condition. If it’s especially sturdy,
the GM might have it take damage but not be broken.
Critical Failure Your attempt jams the door, window, container,
or gate shut, imposing a –2 circumstance penalty on future
attempts to Force it Open.
Sample Force Open Tasks
Untrained fabric, flimsy glass
Trained ice, sturdy glass
Expert flimsy wooden door, wooden portcullis
Master sturdy wooden door, iron portcullis, metal bar
Legendary stone or iron door
GRAPPLE [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You have at least one free hand and your target
is no more than one size larger than you.
You attempt to grab a creature or object with your free hand.
Attempt an Athletics check against the target’s Fortitude
DC. You can Grapple a target you already have grabbed or
restrained without having a hand free.
Critical Success Your target is restrained until the end of your
next turn unless you move or your target Escapes (page 416).
Success Your target is grabbed until the end of your next turn
unless you move or your target Escapes.
Failure You fail to grab your target. If you already had the
target grabbed or restrained using a Grapple, those
conditions on the target end.
Critical Failure If you already had the target grabbed or
restrained, it breaks free. Your target can either grab you,
as if it succeeded at using the Grapple action against you, or
force you to fall and land prone.
HIGH JUMP [two-actions]
You Stride, then attempt a DC 30 Athletics check to jump
vertically. If you didn’t Stride at least 10 feet, you automatically
fail. This DC might be increased or decreased due to the
situation, as determined by the GM.
Critical Success You Leap up to 8 feet vertically and 10 feet
horizontally.
Success You Leap up to 5 feet vertically and 5 feet horizontally.
Failure You Leap normally.
Critical Failure You fall prone in your space.
LONG JUMP [two-actions]
You Stride, then attempt a DC 15 Athletics check to make a long
jump in the direction you were Striding. If you didn’t Stride at least
10 feet, you automatically fail your check. The GM might increase
or decrease this DC depending on the situation.
Success You Leap a distance equal to your check result
rounded down to the nearest 5 feet. You can’t jump farther
than your land Speed.
Failure You make a normal horizontal Leap.
Critical Failure You make a normal horizontal Leap, then fall
and land prone.
REPOSITION [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You either have at least one hand free, or you’re
grabbing or restraining the target. The target can’t be more
than one size larger than you.
You muscle a creature or object around. Attempt an Athletics
check against the target’s Fortitude DC.
Critical Success You move the creature up to 10 feet. It must
remain within your reach during this movement, and you
can’t move it into or through obstacles.
Success You move the target up to 5 feet. It must remain
within your reach during this movement, and you can’t
move it into or through obstacles.

Critical Failure The target can move you up to 5 feet as though
it successfully Repositioned you.
LEAP

The Leap basic action is used for High Jump and Long Jump.
A horizontal Leap lets you jump up to 10 feet horizontally
if your Speed is at least 15 feet, or up to 15 feet horizontally
if your Speed is at least 30 feet. You land in the space
where your Leap ends (meaning you can typically clear a
5-foot gap if your Speed is between 15 feet and 30 feet, or
a 10-foot gap if your Speed is 30 feet or more).
A vertical Leap lets you jump up to 3 feet vertically
and 5 feet horizontally onto an elevated surface.
FORCED MOVEMENT

Reposition and Shove force a creature to move. When
an effect forces you to move, or if you start falling, the
distance you move is defined by the effect that moved
you, not by your Speed. Because you’re not acting
to move, this doesn’t trigger reactions triggered by
movement. See page 422 for full details.
SHOVE [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You have at least one hand free. The target can’t
be more than one size larger than you.
You push a creature away from you. Attempt an Athletics
check against your target’s Fortitude DC.
Critical Success You push your target up to 10 feet away from
you. You can Stride after it, but you must move the same
distance and in the same direction.
Success You push your target back 5 feet. You can Stride after
it, but you must move the same distance and in the same
direction.
Critical Failure You lose your balance, fall, and land prone.
SWIM [one-action]
MOVE
You attempt an Athletics check to move a maximum
distance of 10 feet through water. The GM determines
the DC based on the turbulence or danger of the water; in
most instances of calm water, you get an automatic critical
success. If your land Speed is 40 feet or higher, increase the
maximum possible distance by 5 feet for every 20 feet of
Speed above 20 feet.
If you end your turn in water and haven’t succeeded at a
Swim action that turn, you sink 10 feet or get moved by the
current, as determined by the GM. This doesn’t apply if your
last action on your turn was to enter the water.
Critical Success You move through the water, increasing
the maximum distance by 5 feet.
Success You move through the water.
Critical Failure You make no progress. If you’re holding
your breath (page 437), you lose 1 round of air.
Sample Swim Tasks
Untrained lake or other still water
Trained flowing water, like a river
Expert swiftly flowing river
Master stormy sea
Legendary maelstrom, waterfall
TRIP [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You have at least one hand free. Your target
can’t be more than one size larger than you.
You try to knock a creature to the ground. Attempt an
Athletics check against the target’s Reflex DC.
Critical Success The target falls, lands prone, and takes 1d6
bludgeoning damage.
Success The target falls and lands prone.
Critical Failure You lose your balance, fall, and land prone.
Athletics Trained Action
DISARM [one-action]
ATTACK
Requirements You have at least one hand free. The target
can’t be more than one size larger than you.
You try to knock an item out of a creature’s grasp. Attempt an
Athletics check against the target’s Reflex DC.
Critical Success You knock the item out of the target’s grasp.
It falls to the ground in the target’s space.
Success You weaken your target’s grasp on the item. Further
attempts to Disarm the target of that item gain a +2
circumstance bonus, and the target takes a –2 circumstance
penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring
a firm grasp on the item. The creature can end the effect
by Interacting to change its grip on the item; otherwise, it
lasts as long as the creature holds the item.
Critical Failure You lose your balance and become off-guard
until the start of your next turn.
Crafting (Int)
You can use this skill to create and repair items. Even if
you’re untrained, you can Recall Knowledge.
• Recall Knowledge (page 231) about alchemical
reactions, the value of items, engineering, unusual
materials, and alchemical or mechanical creatures.
The GM determines which creatures this applies to,
but it usually includes constructs.
REPAIR
EXPLORATION MANIPULATE
Requirements You are holding or wearing a repair toolkit
(page 290).
You spend 10 minutes attempting to fix a damaged item, placing
the item on a stable surface and using the repair toolkit with
both hands. Roll a Crafting check. The GM sets the DC, but it’s
usually about the same DC to Repair a given item as it is to Craft
it in the first place. You can’t Repair a destroyed item.

Critical Success You restore 10 Hit Points to the item, plus an
additional 10 Hit Points per proficiency rank you have in
Crafting (a total of 20 HP if you’re trained, 30 HP if you’re
an expert, 40 HP if you’re a master, or 50 HP if you’re
legendary).
Success You restore 5 Hit Points to the item, plus an additional
5 per proficiency rank you have in Crafting (for a total of
10 HP if you are trained, 15 HP if you’re an expert, 20 HP if
you’re a master, or 25 HP if you’re legendary).
Critical Failure You deal 2d6 damage to the item. Apply the
item’s Hardness to this damage.
Crafting Trained Actions
You must be trained in Crafting to use it to Earn Income.
• Earn Income (page 228) by crafting goods for the
market.
CRAFT
DOWNTIME MANIPULATE
You can make an item from raw materials. You need the
Alchemical Crafting skill feat to create alchemical items and
the Magical Crafting skill feat to create magic items.
To Craft an item, you must meet the following requirements:
• The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn’t list
a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you
must be a master in Crafting, and if it’s 17th or higher,
you must be legendary.
• The item must be common, or you must otherwise have
access to it.
• You have an appropriate set of tools and, in many cases,
a workshop. For example, you need access to a smithy
to forge a metal shield, or an alchemist’s lab to produce
alchemical items.
• You must supply raw materials worth at least half the
item’s Price. You always expend at least that amount of
raw materials when you Craft successfully. If you’re in
a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get the
amount of raw materials you need, except in the case of
rarer precious materials.
You attempt a Crafting check after you spend 2 days of
work setting up, or 1 day if you have the item’s formula. The
GM determines the DC to Craft the item based on its level,
rarity, and other circumstances.
If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend
the raw materials you supplied. You can pay the remaining
portion of the item’s Price in materials to complete the item
immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days
working on it. For each additional day you spend, reduce the
value of the materials you need to expend to complete the
item. This amount is determined using the Income Earned
table (page 229), based on your proficiency rank in Crafting
and using your own level instead of a task level.
After any of these downtime days, you can complete
the item by spending the remaining portion of its Price in
materials. If the downtime days you spend are interrupted,
you can return to finish the item later, continuing where you
left off. An example of Crafting appears in the sidebar below.
Critical Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional
day spent Crafting reduces the materials needed to
complete the item by an amount based on your level + 1
and your proficiency rank in Crafting.
Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional day
spent Crafting reduces the materials needed to complete
the item by an amount based on your level and your
proficiency rank.
Failure You fail to complete the item. You can salvage the raw
materials you supplied for their full value. If you want to
try again, you must start over.
Critical Failure You fail to complete the item. You ruin 10% of
the raw materials you supplied, but you can salvage the
rest. If you want to try again, you must start over.
Alchemical and Magical Items
If you want to Craft alchemical items or magic items,
you need to select the skill feat for Alchemical Crafting
(page 252) or Magical Crafting (page 258) in addition
to being trained. Stat blocks and details of these items
appear in GM Core, so consult with your GM.
Crafting Example

Ezren is a 5th-level wizard and an expert in Crafting.
He has a Crafting modifier of +13 and the Magical
Crafting feat. With 2 weeks of downtime ahead of him,
he decides to craft a striking rune, a 4th-level item. The
GM secretly chooses a DC of 19.
The item has a Price of 65 gp, so Ezren prepares 32
gp, 5 sp worth of raw materials. He has another 32 gp,
5 sp worth of raw materials on hand. After spending 1
day building and incanting spells, he rolls a 12 on his
Crafting check, for a result of 25. That’s a success! At
this point, Ezren can spend the additional 32 gp, 5 sp
worth of materials to complete the item immediately
for 65 gp.
However, Ezren has 13 more days on his hands, so
he decides to spend additional time to complete the
item. Because he’s a 5th-level character and an expert
at Crafting, he reduces the amount he has to pay by 1
gp for each day spent. After spending 13 days working,
he reduces the total cost to complete the item from
65 gp to 52 gp. He spends the remaining portion of
its Price in materials, completes the striking rune, and
goes out on his next adventure. (He could have stayed
home to keep working on the striking rune, eventually
reducing the item’s total Price to just the half he paid
up front, but adventuring is far more lucrative!)
If Ezren’s Crafting check result were a 29 or higher,
he’d have gotten a critical success. In that case, he’d
reduce the remaining amount by 2 gp per day (the
amount for a 6th-level expert), lowering the amount
needed to complete the item after 13 additional days of
work to 39 gp.

IDENTIFY ALCHEMY
CONCENTRATE EXPLORATION SECRET
Requirements You are holding or wearing an alchemist’s
toolkit (page 287).
You can identify the nature of an alchemical item with 10
minutes of testing using your alchemist’s toolkit. If your
attempt is interrupted in any way, you must start over.
Success You identify the item and the means of activating it.
Failure You fail to identify the item but can try again.
Critical Failure You misidentify the item as another item of
the GM’s choice.
CONSUMABLES AND AMMUNITION
You can Craft items with the consumable trait in batches,
making up to four of the same item at once with a single
check. This requires you to include the raw materials
for all the items in the batch at the start, and you must
complete the batch all at once. You also Craft non-magical
ammunition in batches, using the quantity listed in the
Ranged Weapons Table (typically 10, page 281).
FORMULAS

A written formula for an item helps you create it with less
difficulty. This has two functions. First, it reduces the time
needed to start Crafting from 2 days to 1, as you have less
preparation to do. Second, you can Craft uncommon and
rarer items if you’re able to acquire their formulas. See the
rules on page 294 for information on formulas.
Deception (Cha)
You can trick and mislead others using disguises, lies,
and other forms of subterfuge. Deception often has a
drawback if you get found out, and it’s often best to be
out of town by the time this happens.
CREATE A DIVERSION [one-action]
MENTAL
With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can
create a diversion that draws creatures’ attention elsewhere.
If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the manipulate
trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the auditory and
linguistic traits.
Attempt a single Deception check and compare it to the
Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you’re
trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures
you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their
Perception DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion
for 1 minute.
Success You become hidden to each creature whose
Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The
hidden condition allows you to Sneak away, as described
on page 245.) This lasts until the end of your turn or
until you do anything except Step or use the Stealth
skill to Hide or Sneak (pages 244 and 245). If you Strike
a creature, the creature remains off-guard against that
attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything
else, you become observed just before you act unless the
GM determines otherwise.
Failure You don’t divert the attention of any creatures whose
Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are
aware you were trying to trick them.
IMPERSONATE
CONCENTRATE EXPLORATION MANIPULATE SECRET
You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or
something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes
10 minutes and requires a disguise kit (found on page 288),
but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not
trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.
In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your
deception only if they use the Seek action to attempt
Perception checks against your Deception DC. If you attempt
to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM
rolls a secret Deception check for you against that creature’s
Perception DC instead.
If you’re disguised as a specific individual, the GM might
give creatures you interact with a circumstance bonus based
on how well they know the person you’re imitating, or the
GM might roll a secret Deception check even if you aren’t
directly interacting with others.

Success You trick the creature into thinking you’re the
person you’re disguised as. You might have to attempt a
new check if your behavior changes.
Failure The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be.
Critical Failure The creature can tell you’re not who you
claim to be, and it recognizes you if it would know you
without a disguise.
LIE
AUDITORY CONCENTRATE LINGUISTIC MENTAL SECRET
You try to fool someone with an untruth. Doing so takes at
least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate. You roll a single
Deception check and compare it against the Perception DC
of every creature you are trying to fool. The GM might give
them a circumstance bonus based on the situation and the
nature of the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly
unbelievable lies are much harder to get a creature to believe
than simpler and more believable lies, and some lies are so
big that it’s impossible to get anyone to believe them.
At the GM’s discretion, if a creature initially believes
your lie, it might attempt a Perception check later to Sense
Motive against your Deception DC to realize it’s a lie. This
usually happens if the creature discovers enough evidence
to counter your statements.
Success The target believes your lie.
Failure The target doesn’t believe your lie and gains a +4
circumstance bonus against your attempts to Lie for the
duration of your conversation. The target is also more
likely to be suspicious of you in the future.
Deception Trained Action
FEINT [one-action]
MENTAL
Requirements You are within melee reach of the target you
attempt to Feint.
With a misleading flourish, you leave an opponent unprepared
for your real attack. Attempt a Deception check against your
target’s Perception DC.
Critical Success You throw your enemy’s defenses against
you entirely off. The target is off-guard against melee
attacks that you attempt against it until the end of your
next turn.
Success Your foe is fooled, but only momentarily. The target
is off-guard against the next melee attack that you attempt
against it before the end of your current turn.
Critical Failure Your feint backfires. You are off-guard against
melee attacks the target attempts against you until the
end of your next turn.
CHANGING ATTITUDES

Your influence on NPCs is measured with a set of attitudes
that reflect how they view your character. These are
only a brief summary of a creature’s disposition. The GM
will supply additional nuance based on the history and
beliefs of the characters you’re interacting with, and their
attitudes can change in accordance with the story. The
attitudes are detailed in the Conditions Appendix and are
summarized here.
• Helpful: Willing to help you and responds favorably to
your requests.
• Friendly: Has a good attitude toward you, but won’t
necessarily stick their neck out to help you.
• Indifferent: Doesn’t care about you either way. (Most
NPCs start out indifferent.)
• Unfriendly: Dislikes you and doesn’t want to help you.
• Hostile: Actively works against you—and might attack
you just because of their dislike.
No one can ever change the attitude of a player
character with these skills. You can roleplay interactions
with player characters, and even use Diplomacy results if
the player wants a mechanical sense of how convincing
or charming a character is, but players make the ultimate
decisions about how their characters respond.
Diplomacy (Cha)
You influence others through negotiation and flattery, or
find out information through friendly chats.
GATHER INFORMATION
EXPLORATION SECRET
You canvass local markets, taverns, and gathering places in
an attempt to learn about a specific individual or topic. The
GM determines the DC of the check and the amount of time
it takes (typically 2 hours, but sometimes more), along with
any benefit you might be able to gain by spending coin on
bribes, drinks, or gifts.
Success You collect information about the individual or topic.
The GM determines the specifics.
Critical Failure You collect incorrect information about the
individual or topic.
Sample Gather Information Tasks
Untrained talk of the town
Trained common rumor
Expert obscure rumor, poorly guarded secret
Master well-guarded or esoteric information
Legendary information known only to an incredibly
select few, or only to extraordinary beings
MAKE AN IMPRESSION
AUDITORY CONCENTRATE EXPLORATION LINGUISTIC MENTAL
With at least 1 minute of conversation, during which you
engage in charismatic overtures, flattery, and other acts of
goodwill, you seek to make a good impression on someone
to make them temporarily agreeable. At the end of the
conversation, attempt a Diplomacy check against the Will

DC of one target. You can instead choose up to five targets
if you take a –2 penalty. The GM might add other bonuses or
penalties based on the situation. Any impression you make
lasts for only the current social interaction unless the GM
decides otherwise. See the Changing Attitudes sidebar for a
summary of the attitude conditions.
Critical Success The target’s attitude toward you improves by
two steps.
Success The target’s attitude toward you improves by one step.
Critical Failure The target’s attitude toward you decreases by
one step.
REQUEST [one-action]
AUDITORY CONCENTRATE LINGUISTIC MENTAL
You can make a request of a creature that’s friendly or helpful
to you. You must couch the request in terms that the target
would accept given their current attitude toward you. The
GM sets the DC based on the difficulty of the request. Some
requests are unsavory or impossible, and even a helpful NPC
would never agree to them.
Critical Success The target agrees to your request without
qualifications.
Success The target agrees to your request, but they might
demand added provisions or alterations to the request.
Failure The target refuses the request, though they might
propose an alternative that is less extreme.
Critical Failure Not only does the target refuse the request,
but their attitude toward you decreases by one step due to
the temerity of the request.
COMMON LORE SUBCATEGORIES
You can learn any Lore skill your GM gives you permission
to take. The following list covers a wide variety of
common Lore topics appropriate for player characters
in most campaigns. Backgrounds often grant you a Lore
skill from this list.
• Academia Lore

• Underworld Lore
• Warfare Lore
Intimidation (Cha)
You bend others to your will using threats. Unlike
Deception or Diplomacy, Intimidation is typically a
blunt instrument with little room for nuance or care.
COERCE
AUDITORY CONCENTRATE EMOTION EXPLORATION LINGUISTIC MENTAL
With threats either veiled or overt, you attempt to bully a
creature into doing what you want. You must spend at least
1 minute of conversation with the creature. At the end of
the conversation, attempt an Intimidation check against
the target’s Will DC, modified by any circumstances the GM
determines. (The attitudes referenced in the effects below are
summarized in the Changing Attitudes sidebar on page 239
and described in full in the Conditions Appendix, starting on
page 442.)
Critical Success The target gives you the information you
seek or agrees to follow your directives so long as they
aren’t likely to harm the target in any way. The target
continues to comply for an amount of time determined
by the GM but not exceeding 1 day, at which point the
target becomes unfriendly (if it wasn’t already unfriendly
or hostile). However, the target is too scared of you to
retaliate—at least in the short term.
Success As critical success, but once the target becomes
unfriendly, they might decide to act against you—for
example, by reporting you to the authorities or assisting
your enemies.
Failure The target doesn’t do what you say, and if they were
not already unfriendly or hostile, they become unfriendly.
Critical Failure The target refuses to comply, becomes hostile
if they weren’t already, and is temporarily immune to your
Coercion for at least 1 week.
DEMORALIZE [one-action]
AUDITORY CONCENTRATE EMOTION FEAR MENTAL
With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting
put-down, you can shake an enemy’s resolve. Choose a
creature within 30 feet of you who you’re aware of. Attempt
an Intimidation check against that target’s Will DC. If the
target doesn’t understand the language you are speaking, or
you’re not speaking a language, you take a –4 circumstance
penalty to the check. Regardless of your result, the target is
temporarily immune to your attempts to Demoralize it for 10
minutes.
Critical Success The target becomes frightened 2.
Success The target becomes frightened 1.
Lore (Int)
You have specialized information on a narrow topic.
Lore features many subcategories. You might have
Military Lore, Sailing Lore, Vampire Lore, or any similar
subcategory of the skill. Each subcategory counts as its
own skill, so applying a skill increase to Planar Lore
wouldn’t increase your proficiency with Sailing Lore, for
example.
Most backgrounds make you trained in a specific
subcategory of the Lore skill. The GM determines what
other subcategories they’ll allow as Lore skills, though these
categories are always less broad than any of the other skills
that allow you to Recall Knowledge, and they should never
be able to take the place of another skill’s Recall Knowledge
action. For instance, you couldn’t choose Magic Lore to recall
the breadth of knowledge about magic covered by Arcana,
Nature, Occultism, and Religion, or choose Adventuring
Lore to give you all the information an adventurer needs, or
choose Planar Lore to gain all the information spread across
various skills and subcategories such as Heaven Lore.
If you’re making a check and multiple subcategories of
Lore could apply, or a non-Lore skill could apply, you can
use whichever skill you prefer. If there’s any doubt whether
a Lore skill applies to a specific topic or action, the GM
decides whether it can be used or not.
Even if you’re untrained in Lore, you can use it to Recall
Knowledge.
• Recall Knowledge (page 231) about the subject of the
Lore skill’s subcategory.
Lore Trained Action
You must be trained in Lore to use it to Earn Income.
• Earn Income (page 228) by using your knowledge
to practice a trade.

Medicine (Wis)
You can patch up wounds and help people recover from
diseases and poisons. Treat Wounds is especially useful,
allowing your adventuring party to heal up between fights.
It can be made more efficient with skill feats like Continual
Recovery (page 254) and Ward Medic (page 265).
Even if you’re untrained in Medicine, you can use it to
Recall Knowledge.
• Recall Knowledge (page 231) about diseases,
injuries, poisons, and other ailments. You can use
this to perform forensic examinations if you spend
10 minutes (or more, as determined by the GM)
checking for evidence such as wound patterns. This
is most useful when determining how a body was
injured or killed.
ADMINISTER FIRST AID [two-actions]
MANIPULATE
Requirements You’re wearing or holding a healer’s toolkit
(page 288).
You perform first aid on an adjacent creature that is dying or
bleeding. If a creature is both dying and bleeding, choose which
ailment you’re trying to treat before you roll. You can Administer
First Aid again to attempt to remedy the other effect.
• Stabilize Attempt a Medicine check on a creature that
has 0 Hit Points and the dying condition. The DC is
equal to 5 + that creature’s recovery roll DC (typically
15 + its dying value).
• Stop Bleeding Attempt a Medicine check on a creature
that is taking persistent bleed damage (page 409). The
DC is usually the DC of the effect that caused the bleed.
Success If you’re trying to stabilize, the target loses the
dying condition (but remains unconscious). If you’re trying
to stop bleeding, the target benefits from an assisted
recovery (page 445) with the lowered DC for particularly
appropriate help.
Critical Failure If you were trying to stabilize, the target’s dying
value increases by 1. If you were trying to stop bleeding, the
target immediately takes an amount of damage equal to its
persistent bleed damage.
Medicine Trained Actions
TREAT DISEASE
DOWNTIME MANIPULATE
Requirements You’re wearing or holding a healer’s toolkit
(page 288).
You spend at least 8 hours caring for a diseased creature.
Attempt a Medicine check against the disease’s DC. After you
attempt to Treat a Disease for a creature, you can’t try again
until after that creature’s next save against the disease.
Critical Success You grant the creature a +4 circumstance
bonus to its next saving throw against the disease.
Success You grant the creature a +2 circumstance bonus to
its next saving throw against the disease.
Critical Failure Your efforts cause the creature to take a –2
circumstance penalty to its next save against the disease.
TREAT POISON [one-action]
MANIPULATE
Requirements You’re wearing or holding a healer’s toolkit
(page 288).
You treat a patient to prevent the spread of poison. Attempt a
Medicine check against the poison’s DC. After you attempt to
Treat a Poison for a creature, you can’t try again until after the
next time that creature attempts a save against the poison.
Critical Success You grant the creature a +4 circumstance
bonus to its next saving throw against the poison.
Success You grant the creature a +2 circumstance bonus to
its next saving throw against the poison.
Critical Failure Your efforts cause the creature to take a –2
circumstance penalty to its next save against the poison.
TREAT WOUNDS
EXPLORATION HEALING MANIPULATE
Requirements You’re wearing or holding a healer’s toolkit
(page 288).
You spend 10 minutes treating one injured living creature
(targeting yourself, if you so choose). The target is then
temporarily immune to Treat Wounds actions for 1 hour, but
this interval overlaps with the time you spent treating (so a
patient can be treated once per hour, not once per 70 minutes).

The Medicine check DC is usually 15, though the GM
might adjust it based on the circumstances, such as treating
a patient outside in a storm, or treating magically cursed
wounds. If you’re an expert in Medicine, you can instead
attempt a DC 20 check to increase the Hit Points regained by
10; if you’re a master of Medicine, you can instead attempt a
DC 30 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 30; and if
you’re legendary, you can instead attempt a DC 40 check to
increase the Hit Points regained by 50. The damage dealt on
a critical failure remains the same.
If you succeed at your check, you can continue treating the
target to grant additional healing. If you treat it for a total of 1
hour, double the Hit Points it regains from Treat Wounds.
The result of your Medicine check determines how many
Hit Points the target regains.
Critical Success The target regains 4d8 Hit Points and loses
the wounded condition.
Success The target regains 2d8 Hit Points, and loses the
wounded condition.
Critical Failure The target takes 1d8 damage.
Nature (Wis)
You know about the natural world, and you command
and train animals and magical beasts. Even if you’re
untrained in Nature, you can use it to Recall Knowledge.
• Recall Knowledge about fauna, flora, geography,
weather, the environment, creatures of natural
origin (like animals, beasts, fey, and plants), the
First World, and the Elemental Planes.
COMMAND AN ANIMAL [one-action]
AUDITORY CONCENTRATE
You issue an order to an animal. Attempt a Nature check
against the animal’s Will DC. The GM might adjust the DC
if the animal has a good attitude toward you, you suggest
a course of action it was predisposed toward, or you offer
it a treat.
You automatically fail if the animal is hostile or unfriendly
to you. If the animal is helpful to you, increase your degree
of success by one step. You might be able to Command an
Animal more easily with a feat like Ride (page 261).
Most animals know the Drop Prone, Leap, Seek, Stand,
Stride, and Strike basic actions. If an animal knows an
activity, such as a horse’s Gallop, you can Command the
Animal to perform the activity, but you must spend as many
actions on Command an Animal as the activity’s number of
actions. You can also spend multiple actions to Command the
Animal to perform that number of basic actions on its next
turn; for instance, you could spend 3 actions to Command
an Animal to Stride three times or to Stride twice and then
make a Strike.
Success The animal does as you command on its next turn.
Failure The animal is hesitant or resistant, and it does
nothing.
Critical Failure The animal misbehaves or misunderstands,
and it takes some other action determined by the GM.
Nature Trained Actions
You must be trained in Nature to use it for the following
general skill actions.
• Identify Magic (page 230), particularly magic of the
primal tradition.
• Learn a Spell (page 230) from the primal tradition.
Occultism (Int)
You know a great deal about ancient philosophies,
esoteric lore, obscure mysticism, and supernatural
creatures. Even if you’re untrained in Occultism, you
can use it to Recall Knowledge.
• Recall Knowledge (page 231) about ancient mysteries;
obscure philosophies; creatures of occult significance
(like aberrations, spirits, and oozes); and esoteric
planes like the Astral Plane, Creation’s Forge, the
Ethereal Plane, the Netherworld, and the Void.
Occultism Trained Actions
You must be trained in Occultism to use it for the
following general skill actions.
• Decipher Writing (page 228) on occult topics,
including complex metaphysical systems, syncretic
principles, obscure philosophies, and incoherent
ramblings.
• Identify Magic (page 230), particularly magic of the
occult tradition.
• Learn a Spell (page 230) from the occult tradition.
COMMANDED ANIMALS

Issuing commands to an animal doesn’t always go
smoothly. An animal is an independent creature with
limited intelligence. Most animals understand only the
simplest instructions, so you might be able to instruct
an animal to move to a certain square but not dictate
a specific path to get there, or command it to attack a
certain creature but not to make its attack nonlethal. The
GM decides the specifics of the action the animal uses.
The animal does what you commanded as soon as
it can, usually as its first action on its next turn. If you
successfully commanded it multiple times, it does what
you said in order. It forgets all commands beyond what
it can accomplish on its turn. If multiple people command
the same animal, the GM determines how the animal
reacts. The GM might also make the DC higher if someone
has already tried to Command the Animal that round.
If you have a pet, animal companion, familiar, or similar
minion, you can command it much more effectively.
Performance (Cha)
You are skilled at a form of performance, using your
talents to impress a crowd or make a living.
Basic Competence
Some performances require you to be more than just
charismatic, and if you don’t meet the demands of the art
form or the audience, the GM might apply a penalty based
on the relevant attribute. For example, if you’re dancing
and have a negative Dexterity modifier, you might take a
penalty to your attempt at dancing. Likewise, if you are
orating and have a negative Intelligence modifier, you
might have to hope your raw Charisma can overcome
the penalties from your intellectual shortcomings—or
ask someone to help write your speeches!
Performance Traits
When you use an action that utilizes the Performance
skill, it gains one or more traits relevant to the type of
performance. The GM might change these depending on

the circumstances, but the most common performance-
based traits are listed below.

If you want to be particularly skilled with one type
of performance, you can select the Virtuosic Performer
skill feat (page 264). That feat breaks down some of the
performance listed above into specific instrument types,
and your GM might allow you to add your own type.

Performance Additional Traits
Act or perform comedy Auditory, linguistic, and visual
Dance Move and visual
Play an instrument Auditory and manipulate
Orate or sing Auditory and linguistic
PERFORM [one-action]
CONCENTRATE
When making a brief performance—one song, a quick dance,
or a few jokes—you use the Perform action. This action is
most useful when you want to prove your capability or
impress someone quickly. Performing rarely has an impact
on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent
Diplomacy checks against the observers, or even change
their attitudes if the GM sees fit.
Critical Success Your performance impresses the observers,
and they’re likely to share stories of your ability.
Success You prove yourself, and observers appreciate the
quality of your performance.
Failure Your performance falls flat.
Critical Failure You demonstrate only incompetence.
Sample Perform Tasks
Untrained audience of commoners
Trained audience of artisans
Expert audience of merchants or minor nobles
Master audience of high nobility or minor royalty
Legendary audience of major royalty or otherworldly
beings
Performance Trained Action
You must be trained in Performance to use it to Earn
Income.
• Earn Income (page 228) by staging a performance.
EXAMINING FORGERIES

A creature on the lookout for forgeries, even one who
was fooled on a passive glance, can take time to closely
examine a document to see if it’s a forgery. They apply
different techniques and analysis methods to look beyond
the surface elements and attempt a secret Perception or
Society check against the forger’s Society DC; any bonus
you had to create the forgery initially applies to this DC.
On a success, the examiner knows the document is a
forgery. On a failure, they think the document is genuine
and can’t try again unless they get a new reason to be
suspicious of the document. If a PC examines a genuine
document, the GM might still pretend to roll a secret
check before revealing the document is genuine.
Religion (Wis)
The secrets of deities, dogma, faith, and the realms of
divine creatures both sublime and sinister are open to
you. You also understand how magic works, though your
training imparts a religious slant to that knowledge. Even
if you’re untrained in Religion, you can use it to Recall
Knowledge.
• Recall Knowledge (page 231) about divine agents,
the finer points of theology, obscure myths regarding
a faith, and creatures of religious significance (like
celestials, fiends, and undead), Creation’s Forge, the
Void, and the Outer Sphere.
Religion Trained Actions
You must be trained in Religion to use it for the following
general skill actions.
• Decipher Writing (page 228) of a religious nature,
including allegories, homilies, and proverbs.
• Identify Magic (page 230), particularly magic of the
divine tradition.
• Learn a Spell (page 230) from the divine tradition.
Society (Int)
You understand the people and systems that make
civilization run, and you know the historical events that
make societies what they are today. Further, you can
use that knowledge to navigate the complex physical,
societal, and economic workings of settlements. Even
if you’re untrained in Society, you can use it for the
following general skill actions.
• Recall Knowledge (page 231) about local history,
important personalities, legal institutions, societal
structure, and humanoid cultures. The GM might
allow Society to apply to other creatures that are
major elements of society in your region, such as the
draconic nobility in a kingdom of humans ruled by
dragons.
• Subsist (page 232) in a settlement by finding shelter,
scrounging, or begging for food.

Society Trained Actions
You must be trained in Society to use it to Decipher
Writing.
• Decipher Writing (page 228) that’s a coded message,
text written in an incomplete or archaic form, or in
some cases, text in a language you don’t know.
CREATE FORGERY
DOWNTIME SECRET
Requirements You provide the proper writing materials for
your forgery.
You create a forged document, usually over the course of a
day or a week. The GM rolls a secret DC 20 Society check. If
you need to forge a specific person’s handwriting, you need
a sample of that person’s handwriting. Otherwise, you need
only to have seen a similar document, and you gain up to a
+4 circumstance bonus to the check (the GM determines the
bonus).
Success The forgery is of good enough quality that passive
observers can’t notice the fake (but see Examining
Forgeries).
Failure The forgery has some obvious signs of being a fake,
potentially allowing passive observers to detect it. Each
time a passive observer sees the document, the GM
compares your check result to the observer’s Perception DC
or Society DC, whichever is higher. If your result doesn’t
exceed a passive observer’s DC, that observer knows the
document is a forgery.
Stealth (Dex)
You are skilled at avoiding detection, allowing you to
slip past foes, hide, or conceal an item.
CONCEAL AN OBJECT [one-action]
MANIPULATE SECRET
You hide a small object on your person (such as a weapon of
light Bulk). When you try to sneak a concealed object past
someone who might notice it, the GM rolls your Stealth check
and compares it to this passive observer’s Perception DC. Once
the GM rolls your check for a concealed object, that same
result is used no matter how many passive observers you try
to sneak it past. If a creature is specifically searching you for
an item, it can attempt a Perception check against your Stealth
DC (finding the object on success).
You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your
person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment
within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters Seeking in
an area compare their Perception check results to your Stealth
DC to determine whether they find the object.
Success The object remains undetected.
Failure The searcher finds the object.
HIDE [one-action]
SECRET
You huddle behind cover or greater cover or deeper into
concealment to become hidden, rather than observed. The GM
rolls your Stealth check in secret and compares the result to
the Perception DC of each creature you’re observed by but
that you have cover or greater cover against or are concealed
from. You get a +2 circumstance bonus to your check if you
have standard cover (or +4 from greater cover).
Success If the creature could see you, you’re now hidden
from it instead of observed. If you were hidden from or
undetected by the creature, you retain that condition.
If you successfully become hidden to a creature but
then cease to have cover or greater cover against it or be
concealed from it, you become observed again. You cease
being hidden if you do anything except Hide, Sneak, or Step.

If you attempt to Strike a creature, the creature remains off-
guard against that attack, and you then become observed. If

you do anything else, you become observed just before you
act unless the GM determines otherwise. The GM might allow
you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without
being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check.
If a creature uses Seek to make you observed by it, you
must successfully Hide to become hidden from it again.
SNEAK [one-action]
MOVE SECRET
You attempt to move to another place while becoming or
staying undetected. Stride up to half your Speed. (You can
use Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming
instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement
type; you must move at half that Speed.)
At the end of your movement, the GM rolls your Stealth
check in secret and compares the result to the Perception
DC of each creature you were hidden from or undetected by
at the start of your movement. If you have cover or greater
cover from the creature throughout your Stride, you gain
the +2 circumstance bonus from cover (or +4 from greater
cover) to your Stealth check. Because you’re moving, the
bonus increase from Taking Cover doesn’t apply. You don’t
get to roll against a creature if, at the end of your movement,
you neither are concealed from it nor have cover or greater
cover against it. You automatically become observed by such
a creature.
Success You’re undetected by the creature during your
movement and remain undetected by the creature at the
end of it.
You become observed as soon as you do anything
other than Hide, Sneak, or Step. If you attempt to Strike
a creature, the creature remains off-guard against that
attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything
else, you become observed just before you act unless the
GM determines otherwise. The GM might allow you to
perform a particularly unobtrusive action without being
noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check. If you
speak or make a deliberate loud noise, you become hidden
instead of undetected.
If a creature uses Seek and you become hidden to it as a
result, you must Sneak if you want to become undetected
by that creature again.
Failure A telltale sound or other sign gives your position away,
though you still remain unseen. You’re hidden from the
creature throughout your movement and remain so.
Critical Failure You’re spotted! You’re observed by the creature
throughout your movement and remain so. If you’re invisible
and were hidden from the creature, instead of being observed
you’re hidden throughout your movement and remain so.
BEING STEALTHY

If you want to sneak around when there are creatures
that can see you, you can use a combination of Hide and
Sneak to do so.
• First, Hide behind something (either by taking
advantage of cover or having the concealed condition
due to fog, a spell, or a similar effect). A successful
Stealth check makes you hidden, though the creatures
still know roughly where you are.
• Second, now that you’re hidden, you can Sneak. That
means you can move at half your Speed and attempt
another Stealth check. If it’s successful, you’re now
undetected. That means the creatures don’t know
which square you’re in anymore.
If you were approaching creatures that didn’t know
you were there, you could begin Sneaking right away,
since they didn’t know your location to start with. Some
actions can cause you to become observed again, but
they’re mostly what you’d expect: standing out in the
open, attacking someone, making a bunch of noise, and
so forth. If you Strike someone after successfully Hiding
or Sneaking, though, they’re off-guard to that Strike.
Creatures can try to find you using the Seek action,
described on page 417.
Three conditions explain the states of detection.
Remember that these conditions are relative to each
creature—you can be observed by one creature while
hidden to another and undetected by a third.
Observed (page 444)
You’re in the creature’s clear view.
Hidden (page 444)
The creature knows your location but can’t see you.
Undetected (page 446)
The creature doesn’t know your location.
UNOBSERVABLE STEALTH

In some cases, it can be impossible for a creature to fully
observe you. Typically this happens if you’re invisible, the
observer is blinded, or you’re in darkness and the creature
can’t see in darkness. In such cases, any critical failure
you roll on a check to Sneak is a failure instead. You also
continue to be undetected if you lose cover or greater cover
against or are no longer concealed from such a creature.
Survival (Wis)
You are adept at living in the wilderness, foraging for
food and building shelter, and with training you discover
the secrets of tracking and hiding your trail. Even if
you’re untrained, you can still use Survival to Subsist.
• Subsist (page 232) in the wild by foraging for food
and building shelter.
SENSE DIRECTION
EXPLORATION SECRET
Using the stars, the position of the sun, traits of the geography
or flora, or the behavior of fauna, you can stay oriented in the
wild. Typically, you attempt a Survival check only once per
day, but some environments or changes might necessitate
rolling more often. The GM determines the DC and how long
this activity takes (usually just a minute or so). More unusual
locales or those you’re unfamiliar with might require you to
have a minimum proficiency rank to Sense Direction. Without
a compass, you take a –2 item penalty to checks to Sense
Direction.
Critical Success You get an excellent sense of where you are. If
you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you know
them exactly.
Success You gain enough orientation to avoid becoming
hopelessly lost. If you are in an environment with cardinal
directions, you have a sense of those directions.
Sense Direction Tasks
Untrained determine a cardinal direction using the sun
Trained find an overgrown path in a forest
Expert navigate a hedge maze
Master navigate a byzantine labyrinth or relatively
featureless desert
Legendary navigate an ever-changing dream realm
Survival Trained Actions
COVER TRACKS
CONCENTRATE EXPLORATION MOVE
You cover your tracks, moving up to half your travel Speed,
using the rules on page 438. You don’t need to attempt a
Survival check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you
must succeed at a Survival check against your Survival DC if it
is higher than the normal DC to Track.
In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In
this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn’t have the
exploration trait.
TRACK
CONCENTRATE EXPLORATION MOVE
You follow tracks, moving at up to half your travel Speed, using
the rules on page 438. After a successful check to Track, you
can continue following the tracks at half your Speed without
attempting additional checks for up to 1 hour.
In some cases, you might Track in an encounter. In this
case, Track is a single action and doesn’t have the exploration

trait, but you might need to roll more often because you’re
in a tense situation. The GM determines how often you must
attempt this check.
You attempt your Survival check when you start Tracking,
once every hour you continue tracking, and any time something
significant changes in the trail. The GM determines the DCs
for such checks, depending on the freshness of the trail, the
weather, and the type of ground.
Success You find the trail or continue to follow the one you’re
already following.
Failure You lose the trail but can try again after a 1-hour delay.
Critical Failure You lose the trail and can’t try again for 24 hours.

Sample Track Tasks
Untrained the path of a large army following a road
Trained relatively fresh tracks of a rampaging bear
through the plains
Expert a nimble panther’s tracks through a jungle, tracks
obscured by rainfall
Master tracks obscured by winter snow, tracks of a
mouse or smaller creature, tracks left on surfaces that
can’t hold prints like bare rock
Legendary old tracks through a windy desert’s sands,
tracks obscured by a major blizzard or hurricane
Thievery (Dex)
You are trained in a particular set of skills favored by
thieves and miscreants.
PALM AN OBJECT [one-action]
MANIPULATE
You pick up a small, unattended object and try not to be
noticed. Roll a single Thievery check against the Perception
DCs of all creatures who are currently observing you. You can
typically only Palm Objects of negligible Bulk, though the GM
might determine otherwise depending on the situation.
Success The creature doesn’t notice you Palming the Object.
Failure The creature notices you Palming the Object.
STEAL [one-action]
MANIPULATE
You try to take a small object from another creature without
being noticed. Typically, you can Steal only an object of
negligible Bulk, and you automatically fail if the creature who
has the object is in combat or on guard.
Attempt a Thievery check to determine if you successfully
Steal the object. The DC is usually the Perception DC of the
creature wearing the object. It’s easiest to steal an object
that is worn but not closely guarded (like a loosely carried
pouch filled with coins, or an object within such a pouch). The
GM might increase the DC if the object is protected or if the
nature of the object makes it harder to steal (such as a very
small item in a large pack, or a sheet of parchment mixed
in with other documents). For instance, the DC is typically 5
higher if the object is in a pocket, held in a creature’s hand, or
similarly protected.
You might also need to compare your Thievery check result
against the Perception DCs of observers other than the person
wearing the object. The GM might impose a circumstance
penalty to the DCs of observers who are distracted.
Success You steal the item without the bearer noticing, or an
observer doesn’t see you take or attempt to take the item.
Failure The item’s bearer notices your attempt before you can
take the object, or an observer sees you take or attempt
to take the item. The GM determines the response of any
creature that notices your theft.
Thievery Trained Actions
DISABLE A DEVICE [two-actions]
MANIPULATE
This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device.
Often, a device requires numerous successes before becoming
disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. A thieves’
toolkit is helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device,
as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a
higher proficiency rank in Thievery to disable it.
Your Thievery check result determines your progress.
Critical Success You disable the device, or you achieve two
successes toward disabling a device requiring more than one
success. You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can
rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.

Success You disable the device, or you achieve one success
toward disabling a device that requires more than one success.
Critical Failure You trigger the device.
PICK A LOCK [two-actions]
MANIPULATE
Requirements You’re holding or wearing a thieves’ toolkit (page
292).
Opening a lock without a key is very similar to Disabling a
Device, but the DC of the check is determined by the complexity
and construction of the lock you are attempting to pick (locks
and their DCs are found on page 288). Locks of higher quality
might require multiple successes to unlock. If you lack the
proper tools, the GM might let you use improvised picks, which
are treated as a shoddy toolkit.
Critical Success You unlock the lock, or you achieve two
successes toward opening a lock that requires more than one
success. You leave no trace of your tampering.
Success You open the lock, or you achieve one success toward
opening a lock that requires more than one success. You
leave behind damage that indicates the lock was picked on
close scrutiny.
Critical Failure You break your toolkit and leave behind obvious
damage. Fixing a broken toolkit requires using Crafting to
Repair it or else swapping in replacement picks (costing 3 sp,
or 3 gp for an infiltrator thieves’ toolkit).
