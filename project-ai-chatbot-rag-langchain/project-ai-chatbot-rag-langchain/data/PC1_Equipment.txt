CHAPTER 6:
EQUIPMENT
To make your mark on the world, you’ll need to have the right equipment, including armor,
weapons, and other gear. This chapter presents the various equipment that you can purchase
during character creation. You can usually find these items for sale in most cities and other
large settlements.
Your character starts out with 15 gold pieces (150 silver
pieces) to spend on any common items from this chapter.
Items with an uncommon rarity can be purchased only if
you have special access from abilities you selected during
character creation or your GM gives you permission
to purchase them. Quick equipment packages for each
class appear on page 268.
Once you’ve purchased your starting items, there are
three main ways to gain new items and equipment: you
can find them during an adventure, make them using the
Crafting skill, or purchase them from a merchant.
Coins and Currency
Though you might be able to barter valuable items
in some areas, currency is the most versatile way to
make transactions when you head to market. The most
common currency is coins. There are four common types
of coins, each standardized in weight and value.
• The copper piece (cp) is worth one-tenth of a
silver piece.
• The silver piece (sp) is the standard unit of currency.
Each silver piece is a standard weight of silver and is
typically accepted by any merchant or kingdom no
matter where it was minted.
• The gold piece (gp) is often used for purchasing magic
items and other expensive items, as 1 gold piece is
worth 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces.
• The platinum piece (pp) is used for the purchase of
very expensive items or as a way to easily transport
large sums of currency. A platinum piece is worth 10
gold pieces, 100 silver pieces, or 1,000 copper pieces.
Other Currency
Art objects, gems, and raw materials (such as those used
for the Craft activity) can be used much like currency:
you can sell them for the same Price you can buy them.
Price
Most items in the following tables have a Price, which is
the amount of currency it typically takes to purchase that
item. An item with a Price of “—“ can’t be purchased. An
item with a Price of 0 is normally free, but its value could
be higher based on the materials used to create it. Most
items can be sold for half their Price, but coins, gems, art
objects, and raw materials (such as components for the
Craft activity) can be exchanged for their full Price.
Item Level
Each item has an item level, which represents the item’s
complexity and any magic used in its construction. Simpler
items with a lower level are easier to construct, and you
can’t Craft items that have a higher level than your own
(page 236). If an item’s level isn’t listed, its level is 0. While
characters can use items of any level, GMs should keep
in mind that allowing characters access to items far above
their current level may have a negative impact on the game.
Carrying Items
A character carries items in three ways: held, worn,
and stowed. Held items are in your hands; a character
typically has two hands, allowing them to hold an
item in each hand or a single two-handed item using
both hands. Worn items are tucked into pockets, belt
pouches, bandoliers, weapon sheaths, and so forth, and
they can be retrieved and returned relatively quickly.
Stowed items are in a backpack or a similar container,
and they are more difficult to access.
Wielding Items
Some abilities require you to wield an item, typically a
weapon. You’re wielding an item any time you’re holding
it in the number of hands needed to use it effectively.
When wielding an item, you’re not just carrying it
around—you’re ready to use it. Other abilities might
require you to be wearing the item, to be holding it, or
simply to have it.
Drawing and Stowing Items
Drawing a worn item or changing how you’re carrying
an item usually requires you to use an Interact action (or
sometimes the Release action). The options are detailed
on page 268. Many ways of using items require you to
spend multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion
worn at your belt requires using an Interact action to
draw it and then using a second action to drink it as
described in its Activate entry.
The number of hands you need to Interact is usually
clear, and if it changes during the action the action takes
the maximum number of hands needed during it. The
GM decides if it’s unclear. You can draw, pick up, or
hold an item that needs two hands using only one hand,
but you need to subsequently change your grip to hold it
in two hands if you want to wield or use it.
QUICK EQUIPMENT PACKAGES

If you want to quickly decide how to spend your starting money on what your class needs, start with one of these batches
of starting gear. An adventurer’s pack, which is included in each kit, contains a backpack, a bedroll, 10 pieces of chalk, flint
and steel, 50 feet of rope, 2 weeks’ rations, soap, 5 torches, and a waterskin. The Options section lists items that aren’t in
the base package but that many characters of the class might like to buy.

Interact
You can use the Interact action (page 416) to:
• Draw, put away, or swap an item. You must be holding
the item to put it away or wearing it to draw it. Swapping
allows you to put away one item and draw another
in the same action (such as putting away a dagger
and drawing a mace). Abilities that specify what you
do when you Interact only allow this if they say so;
the Quick Draw feat lets a rogue Interact to draw a
weapon, but doesn’t allow them to stow one as well.
Swapping lets you swap only one item for another; if
you were wielding two weapons, you could put away
one of them and draw a different item, but you would
need to put away the second weapon separately.
• Pick up an item from the ground.

• Pass off or take a held item from a willing creature.
The creature you’re passing to must have a hand free.
You can also attempt to throw an item to someone.
You typically need to succeed at a DC 15 ranged
attack with a 10-foot range increment to do so.
• Detach a shield or other item from you using one hand.
• Change your grip by adding a hand to an item.
• Retrieve a stowed item from a backpack, pouch, or
similar container (or put one away). You’ll often need
to Interact to open or close the backpack or container.
Release
You can use the Release free action (page 417) to:
• Drop an item to the ground.
• Change your grip by removing a hand from an item.
Bulk
Carrying especially heavy or unwieldy items can make
it more difficult for you to move, as can overloading
yourself with too much gear. The Bulk value of an item
reflects how difficult the item is to handle, representing its
size, weight, and general awkwardness. If you have a high
Strength modifier, you usually don’t need to worry about
Bulk unless you’re carrying numerous substantial items.
Bulk Limits
You can carry an amount of Bulk equal to 5 plus your
Strength modifier without penalty; if you carry more,
you gain the encumbered condition. You can’t hold or
carry more Bulk than 10 plus your Strength modifier.

ENCUMBERED

You are carrying more weight than you can manage.
While you’re encumbered, you’re clumsy 1 and take a
–10-foot penalty to all your Speeds. As with all penalties
to your Speed, this can’t reduce your Speed below 5 feet.
Bulk Values
Items can have a number to indicate their Bulk value,
or they can be light (indicated by an L) or negligible
(indicated by a —) for the purpose of determining Bulk.
For instance, full plate armor is 4 Bulk, a longsword is
1 Bulk, a dagger or scroll is light, and a piece of chalk
is negligible. Ten light items count as 1 Bulk, and you
round down fractions (so 9 light items count as 0 Bulk,
and 11 light items count as 1 Bulk). Items of negligible
Bulk don’t count toward Bulk unless you try to carry
vast numbers of them, as determined by the GM.
Estimating an Item’s Bulk
Generally, an item that weighs 5 to 10 pounds is 1 Bulk,
an item weighing less than a few ounces is negligible, and
anything in between is light. Particularly unwieldy items
might have higher Bulk values. For example, a 10-foot pole
isn’t heavy, but its length makes it awkward to manage,
so its Bulk is 1. Items made for larger or smaller creatures
have greater or lesser Bulk, as described on page 270.
Bulk of Coins
Coins are a popular means of exchange due to their
portability, but they can still add up. A thousand coins
of any denomination or combination of denominations
count as 1 Bulk. It’s not usually necessary to determine
the Bulk of coins in fractions of 1,000; simply round
down fractions of 1,000. In other words, 100 coins don’t
count as a light item, and 1,999 coins are 1 Bulk, not 2.
Bulk of Creatures
You might need to know the Bulk of a creature, especially
if you need to carry someone. This table lists the typical
Bulk of a creature, but the GM might adjust this number.

Size of Creature Bulk
Tiny 1
Small 3
Medium 6
Large 12
Huge 24
Gargantuan 48
Dragging
In some situations, you might drag an object or creature
rather than carry it. If you’re dragging something, treat its
Bulk as half. Typically, you can drag one thing at a time,
you must use both hands to do so, and you drag slowly—
roughly 50 feet per minute. Use the total Bulk of what
you’re dragging, for instance, if you’re dragging a sack
filled with treasure, total the Bulk of everything inside.
Item Damage
An item can be broken or destroyed if it takes enough
damage. Every item has a Hardness value. Each time an
item takes damage, reduce any damage the item takes by
its Hardness. The rest of the damage reduces the item’s
Hit Points. Normally an item takes damage only when
a creature is directly attacking it—commonly targeted
items include doors and traps. A creature that attacks
you doesn’t normally damage your armor or other gear,
even if it hits you. However, the Shield Block reaction
can cause your shield to take damage as you use it to
prevent damage to yourself, and some monsters have
exceptional abilities that can damage your items.
An item that takes damage can become broken and
eventually destroyed. It becomes broken when its Hit
Points are equal to or lower than its Broken Threshold
(BT); once its Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is destroyed.
A broken item has the broken condition until Repaired
above its Broken Threshold. Anything that automatically
makes an item broken immediately reduces its Hit Points
to its Broken Threshold if the item had more Hit Points
than that when the effect occurred. If an item has no
Broken Threshold, then it has no relevant changes to its
function due to being broken, but it’s still destroyed at 0
Hit Points. A destroyed item can’t be Repaired.
An item’s Hardness, Hit Points, and Broken Threshold
usually depend on the material the item is made of.
Information on materials appears in GM Core.
Object Immunities
Inanimate objects and hazards are immune to bleed, death
effects, disease, healing, mental effects, nonlethal attacks,
poison, spirit, vitality, void, as well as the doomed,
drained, fatigued, paralyzed, sickened, and unconscious
conditions. Conscious, thinking items are not immune
to mental effects. Many objects are immune to other
conditions, at the GM’s discretion. For instance, a sword
can’t move, so it can’t take a penalty to its Speed, but a
spinning blade trap might be affected.
BROKEN

Broken is a condition that affects objects. An object is
broken when damage has reduced its Hit Points below its
Broken Threshold. A broken object can’t be used for
its normal function, nor does it grant bonuses—
with the exception of armor. Broken armor
still grants its item bonus to AC, but it also
imparts a status penalty to AC depending
on its category: –1 for broken light armor,
–2 for broken medium armor, or –3 for
broken heavy armor.
A broken item still imposes penalties and
limitations normally incurred by carrying,
holding, or wearing it. For example, broken
armor would still impose its Dexterity
modifier cap, check penalty, and so forth.
If an effect makes an item broken automatically
and the item has more HP than its Broken Threshold, that
effect also reduces the item’s current HP to the Broken
Threshold.
Shoddy Items
Improvised or of dubious make, shoddy items are never
available for purchase except for in the most desperate
of communities. When available, a shoddy item usually
costs half the Price of a standard item, though you can
never sell one.
Attacks and checks involving a shoddy item take a
–2 item penalty. This penalty also applies to any DCs
that a shoddy item applies to (such as the AC provided
when wearing shoddy armor, or the DC to break out of
shoddy manacles). A shoddy suit of armor also worsens
the armor’s check penalty by 2. A shoddy item’s Hit
Points and Broken Threshold are each half that of a
normal item of its type.
Items and Sizes
The Bulk rules in this chapter are for Small and Medium
creatures, as most ancestries are these sizes; however,
other uncommon or rare ancestries might be larger or
smaller and require items specially made for creatures
of those sizes. Large creatures can carry more, and
smaller creatures can carry less, as noted on the Bulk
Conversions table.
These rules for Bulk limits come up most often when
a group tries to load up a mount or animal companion.
The rules for items of different sizes tend to come into
play when the characters defeat a big creature that has
gear, since usually the only creatures of other sizes are
creatures under the GM’s control.
In most cases, Small or Medium creatures can wield
a Large weapon, though it’s unwieldy, giving them the
clumsy 1 condition, and the larger size is canceled by the
difficulty of swinging the weapon, so it grants no special
benefit. Large armor is simply too large for Small and
Medium creatures.

Bulk Conversions for Different Sizes
As shown in the Bulk Conversions table, Large or larger
creatures are less encumbered by bulky items than Small
or Medium creatures, while Tiny creatures become
overburdened more quickly. A Large creature treats
10 items of 1 Bulk as 1 Bulk, a Huge creature treats
10 items of 2 Bulk as 1 Bulk, and so on. A Tiny
creature treats 10 items of negligible Bulk as
1 Bulk. Negligible items work in a similar
way—a Huge creature treats items of 1 Bulk
as negligible, so it can carry any number of
items of 1 Bulk. A Tiny creature doesn’t treat
any items as having negligible Bulk.
BULK CONVERSIONS
Creature Bulk Treats Treats as
Size Limit as Light Negligible
Tiny Half — none
Small or Med. Standard L —
Large x2 1 Bulk L
Huge x4 2 Bulk 1 Bulk
Gargantuan x8 4 Bulk 2 Bulk
Items of Different Sizes
Creatures of sizes other than Small or Medium need items
appropriate to their size. These items have different Bulk
and possibly a different Price. The Differently Sized Items
table provides the Price and Bulk conversion for such items.
DIFFERENTLY SIZED ITEMS
Creature Light Negligible
Size Price Bulk Becomes Becomes
Tiny Standard Half* — —
Small or Med. Standard Standard L —
Large x2 x2 1 Bulk L
Huge x4 x4 2 Bulk 1 Bulk
Gargantuan x8 x8 4 Bulk 2 Bulk
* An item that would have its Bulk reduced below 1 has
light Bulk.
For example, a morningstar sized for a Medium creature
has a Price of 1 gp and 1 Bulk, so one made for a Huge
creature is 4 gp and 4 Bulk. One made for a Tiny creature still
costs 1 gp (due to its intricacy) and has 1/2 Bulk (rounding
down to light Bulk). Because the way that a creature treats
Bulk and the Bulk of gear sized for it scale the same way,
Tiny or Large (or larger) creatures can usually wear and
carry about the same amount of gear as a Medium creature.
Higher-level magic items that cost significantly more
than 8 times the cost of a mundane item use their listed
Price regardless of size. Precious materials, however, have
a Price based on the Bulk of the item, so multiply the Bulk
value as described on the Differently Sized Items table,
then use the formula in the material’s entry to determine
the item’s Price. See page 252 of GM Core for more
information on materials.
ARMOR
Armor increases your character’s defenses, but some medium or heavy armor can hamper
movement. If you want to increase your character’s defense beyond the protection your
armor provides, they can use a shield. Armor protects your character only while they’re
wearing it.
Armor Class
Your Armor Class (AC) measures how well you can
defend against attacks. When a creature attacks you,
your Armor Class is the DC for that attack roll.
Armor Class = 10 + Dexterity modifier (up to your
armor’s Dex Cap) + proficiency bonus + armor’s item
bonus to AC + other bonuses + penalties
Use your proficiency bonus for the category (light,
medium, or heavy) or for the specific type of armor
you’re wearing. If you’re not wearing armor, use your
proficiency in unarmored defense.
Donning and Removing
Armor
Getting in and out of armor is time consuming—so
make sure you’re wearing it when you need it! Donning
and removing armor are both activities involving many
Interact actions. It takes 1 minute to don light armor, 5
minutes to don medium or heavy armor, and 1 minute to
remove any armor.
Armor Statistics
The Unarmored Defense table (page 273) provides the
statistics for the various forms of protection without
wearing armor. The Armor table (page 273) provides the
statistics for suits of armor that can be purchased and
worn, organized by category. The columns in both tables
provide the following statistics.
Category
The armor’s category—unarmored, light armor, medium
armor, or heavy armor—indicates which proficiency
bonus you use while wearing the armor.
AC Bonus
This number is the item bonus you add for the armor
when determining Armor Class.
Dexterity Modifier Cap (Dex Cap)
This number is the maximum amount of your Dexterity
modifier that can apply to your AC while you are
wearing a given suit of armor. For example, if you
have a Dexterity modifier of +4 and you are wearing
a suit of half plate, you apply only a +1 bonus from
your Dexterity modifier to your AC while wearing
that armor.
Check Penalty
While wearing your armor, you take this penalty to
Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks, except for
those that have the attack trait. If you meet the armor’s
Strength threshold (see Strength below), you don’t take
this penalty.
Speed Penalty
While wearing a suit of armor, you take the penalty listed in
this entry to your Speed, as well as to any other movement
types you have, such as a climb Speed or swim Speed, to a
minimum Speed of 5 feet. If you meet the armor’s Strength
threshold (see below), you reduce the penalty by 5 feet.
Strength
This entry indicates the Strength modifier at which you
are strong enough to overcome some of the armor’s
penalties. If your Strength modifier is equal to or greater
than this value, you no longer take the armor’s check
penalty, and you decrease the Speed penalty by 5 feet
(to no penalty if the penalty was –5 feet, or to a –5-foot
penalty if the penalty was –10 feet).
Bulk
This entry gives the armor’s Bulk, assuming you’re
wearing the armor and distributing its weight across
your body. A suit of armor that’s carried usually has 1
more Bulk than what’s listed here (or 1 Bulk total for
armor of light Bulk). An armor’s Bulk is increased or
decreased if it’s sized for creatures that aren’t Small or
Medium in size, following the rules on page 270.
Group
Each type of clothing and armor belongs to an armor
group, which classifies it with similar types of armor.
Some abilities reference armor groups, typically to grant
armor specialization effects, which are described on
page 272.
Armor Traits
The traits for each suit of armor presented in this book
appear in this entry.
Bulwark: The armor covers you so completely that
it provides benefits against some damaging effects. On
Reflex saves to avoid a damaging effect, such as a fireball,
you add a +3 modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier.
Comfort: The armor is so comfortable that you can
rest normally while wearing it.
MATERIALS

Most suits of armor and weapons are made from ordinary,
commonly available materials like iron, leather, steel, and
wood. If you’re not sure what a suit of armor is made of,
the GM determines the details.
Some armor, shields, and weapons are instead
made of precious materials. These often have inherent
supernatural properties. Cold iron, for example, harms
fey, and silver can damage werecreatures. These materials
are detailed in GM Core beginning on page 252.
DAMAGING ARMOR

Your armor’s statistics are based on the material it’s
predominantly made from. It’s not likely your armor will
take damage, as explained in Item Damage on page 269.
Material Hardness HP BT Armors
Cloth 1 4 2 Explorer’s clothing,
padded armor
Leather 4 16 8 Hide, leather, studded
leather
Metal 9 36 18 Breastplate, chain mail,
chain shirt, full plate,
half plate, scale mail,
splint mail
Flexible: The armor is pliable and doesn’t hinder most
actions. You don’t apply its check penalty to Acrobatics
or Athletics checks.
Noisy: This armor is loud and likely to alert others to
your presence. The armor’s check penalty applies to Stealth
checks even if you have the required Strength modifier.
Armor Specialization
Effects
Certain class features can grant you additional benefits
with certain armors. This is called an armor specialization
effect. The exact effect depends on which armor group
your armor belongs to, as listed below.
Chain: The armor can bend with a critical hit and absorb
some of the blow. Reduce the damage from critical hits
by 4 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium
armor, or 6 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for
heavy armor. This can’t reduce the damage to less than the
damage rolled for the hit before doubling for a critical hit.
Composite: The numerous overlapping pieces of
this armor protect you from piercing attacks. You gain
resistance to piercing damage equal to 1 + the value of
the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the
value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
Leather: The thick second skin of the armor disperses
blunt force to reduce bludgeoning damage. You gain
resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + the value
of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 +
the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.

Plate: The sturdy plate provides no purchase for a
cutting edge. You gain resistance to slashing damage
equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for
medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency
rune for heavy armor.
Armor Descriptions
Each type of armor is described in more detail below.
Breastplate: Though referred to as a breastplate,
this type of armor consists of several pieces of plate
or half-plate armor (see below) that protect the torso,
chest, neck, and sometimes the hips and lower legs. It
strategically grants some of the protection of plate while
allowing greater flexibility and speed.
Chain Mail: A suit of chain mail consists of several
pieces of armor composed of small metal rings linked
together in a protective mesh. It typically includes a chain
shirt, leggings, a pair of arms, and a coif, collectively
protecting most of the body.
Chain Shirt: Sometimes called a hauberk, this is a long
shirt constructed of the same metal rings as chainmail.
However, it is much lighter than chainmail and protects
only the torso, upper arms, and upper legs of its wearer.
Explorer’s Clothing: Adventurers who don’t wear
armor travel in durable clothing. Though it’s not armor
and uses your unarmored defense proficiency, it still has a
Dex Cap and can grant an item bonus to AC if etched with
potency runes (as described on page 226 of GM Core).
Full Plate: Plate mail consists of interlocking plates
that encase nearly the entire body in a carapace of steel.
It is costly and heavy, and the wearer often requires
help to don it correctly, but it provides some of the best
defense armor can supply. A suit of this armor comes
with an undercoat of padded armor (see below) and a
pair of gauntlets (page 277).
Half Plate: Half plate consists of most of the upper
body plates used in full plate, with lighter or sparser
steel plate protection for the arms and legs. This
provides some of the protection of full plate with greater
flexibility and speed. A suit of this armor comes with an
undercoat of padded armor (see below) and a pair of
gauntlets (page 277).
Hide: A mix of furs, sturdy hide, and sometimes
molded boiled leather, this armor provides protection
due to its layers of leather, though its bulkiness slows
the wearer down and decreases mobility.
Leather: A mix of flexible and molded boiled leather,
a suit of this type of armor provides some protection
with maximum flexibility.
Padded Armor: This armor is simply a layer of heavy,
quilted cloth, but it is sometimes used because it’s so
inexpensive. Padded armor is easier to damage and
destroy than other types of armor. Heavy armor comes
with a padded armor undercoat included in its Price,
though it loses the comfort trait when worn under heavy
armor. You can wear just that padded armor undercoat 
to sleep in, if your heavy armor is destroyed, or when
otherwise not wearing the full heavy armor. This allows
you to keep magic armor invested and benefit from the
power of any runes on the associated heavy armor, but
no one else can wear your heavy armor without the
padded undercoat.
Scale Mail: Scale mail consists of many metal scales
sewn onto a reinforced leather backing, often in the form
of a long shirt that protects the torso, arms, and legs.

Splint Mail: This type of armor is chain mail reinforced
with flexible, interlocking metal plates, typically located
on the wearer’s torso, upper arms, and legs. A suit of this
armor comes with an undercoat of padded armor (see
above) and a pair of gauntlets (page 277).
Studded Leather: This leather armor is reinforced
with metal studs and sometimes small metal plates,
providing most of the flexibility of leather armor with
more robust protection.

SHIELDS
A shield can increase your character’s defense beyond the protection their armor provides.
Your character must be wielding a shield in one hand to make use of it, and it grants its
bonus to AC only if they use an action to Raise a Shield. This action grants the shield’s
bonus to AC as a circumstance bonus until their next turn starts. A shield’s Speed penalty
applies whenever your character is holding the shield, whether they have raised it or not.
Raise a Shield is the action most commonly used with
shields. All shields, unless specifically noted or described
otherwise, must be strapped to your arm and held in one
hand, so you can’t hold anything with that hand and
Raise a Shield, and you lose the shield’s benefits if that
hand is no longer free. A buckler, however, doesn’t take
up your hand, so you can Raise a Shield with a buckler if
the hand is free (or, at the GM’s discretion, if it’s holding
a simple, lightweight object that’s not a weapon).
When you have a tower shield raised, you can use the
Take Cover action (page 418) to increase the circumstance
bonus to AC to +4. This lasts until the shield is no longer
raised, or until any of the normal conditions that end Take
Cover, whichever comes first. If you would provide lesser
cover against an attack, having your tower shield raised
provides standard cover against it (and other creatures can
Take Cover as normal using the cover from your shield).
If you have access to the Shield Block reaction (from
your class or from a feat), you can use it while Raising
your Shield to reduce the damage you take by an amount
equal to the shield’s Hardness. Both you and the shield
then take any remaining damage.
Shield Statistics
Shields have statistics that follow the same rules as armor:
Price, Speed Penalty, and Bulk. See page 271 for the rules
for those statistics. Their other statistics are described here.
AC Bonus
A shield grants a circumstance bonus to AC, but only
when the shield is raised. This requires using the Raise a
Shield action, found on page 419.
Hardness
Whenever a shield takes damage, the amount of damage it
takes is reduced by this amount. This number is particularly
relevant for shields because of the Shield Block feat (page
262). The rules for Hardness appear on page 269.
A shield can increase your character’s defense beyond the protection their armor provides.
Your character must be wielding a shield in one hand to make use of it, and it grants its
bonus to AC only if they use an action to Raise a Shield. This action grants the shield’s
bonus to AC as a circumstance bonus until their next turn starts. A shield’s Speed penalty
applies whenever your character is holding the shield, whether they have raised it or not.

SHIELDS

HP (BT)
This column lists the shield’s Hit Points (HP) and
Broken Threshold (BT). These measure how much
damage the shield can take before it’s destroyed (its
total HP) and how much it can take before being
broken and unusable its BT). These matter primarily
for the Shield Block reaction.
Attacking with a Shield
A shield can be used as a martial weapon for attacks, using
the statistics listed for a shield bash on the Martial Melee
Weapons table (page 278). The shield bash is an option only
for shields that weren’t designed to be used as weapons. A
shield can’t have runes added to it. You can also buy and
attach a shield boss or shield spikes to a shield to make it
a more practical weapon. These can also be found on the
Martial Melee Weapons table (page 278). These work like
other weapons and can even be etched with runes.
Shield Descriptions
Each type of shield is described in more detail below.
Buckler: This very small shield is a favorite of duelists
and quick, lightly armored warriors. It’s typically made
of steel and strapped to your forearm. You can Raise a
Shield with your buckler as long as you have that hand
free or are holding a light object that’s not a weapon in
that hand.
Wooden Shield: Though they come in a variety of
shapes and sizes, the protection offered by wooden
shields comes from the stoutness of their materials.
While wooden shields are less expensive than steel
shields, they break more easily.
Steel Shield: Like wooden shields, steel shields come
in a variety of shapes and sizes. Though more expensive
than wooden shields, they are much more durable.
Tower Shield: These massive shields can be used to
provide cover to nearly the entire body. Due to their size,
they are typically made of wood reinforced with metal.

WEAPONS
Most characters in Pathfinder carry weapons, ranging from mighty warhammers to graceful
bows to even simple clubs. Full details on how you calculate the bonuses, modifiers, and
penalties for attack rolls and damage rolls are given on pages 400–403 and 406–407, but
they’re summarized here, followed by the rules for weapons and dozens of weapon choices.
Attack Rolls
When making an attack roll, determine the result by
rolling 1d20 and adding your attack modifier for the
weapon or unarmed attack you’re using. Modifiers for
melee and ranged attacks are calculated differently—see
page 402 for full details.
Melee attack roll result = d20 roll + Strength modifier
(or optionally Dexterity modifier for a finesse weapon) +
proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
Ranged attack roll result = d20 roll + Dexterity modifier
+ proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
Multiple Attack Penalty
If you use an action with the attack trait more than
once on the same turn, your attacks after the first take
a penalty called a multiple attack penalty. Your second
attack takes a –5 penalty, and any subsequent attacks
take a –10 penalty.
The multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to attacks
you make when it isn’t your turn (such as attacks made
as part of a reaction, like Reactive Strike). You can use
a weapon with the agile trait (page 282) to reduce your
multiple attack penalty.
Damage Rolls
When the result of your attack roll with a weapon or
unarmed attack equals or exceeds your target’s AC, you
hit your target! Roll the weapon or unarmed attack’s
damage die and add the relevant modifiers, bonuses, and
penalties to determine the amount of damage you deal.
Calculate a damage roll as follows (full details are on
page 406).
Melee damage roll = damage die of weapon or unarmed
attack + Strength modifier + bonuses + penalties
Ranged damage roll = damage die of weapon (+ Strength
modifier for a thrown weapon or half Strength modifier
for a propulsive weapon) + bonuses + penalties
Ranged weapons don’t normally add an attribute
modifier to the damage roll, though weapons with
the propulsive trait (page 282) add half your Strength
modifier (or your full modifier if it is a negative number),
and thrown weapons add your full Strength modifier.
Most characters in Pathfinder carry weapons, ranging from mighty warhammers to graceful
bows to even simple clubs. Full details on how you calculate the bonuses, modifiers, and
penalties for attack rolls and damage rolls are given on pages 400–403 and 406–407, but
they’re summarized here, followed by the rules for weapons and dozens of weapon choices.

WEAPONS

Magic weapons with striking, greater striking, or
major striking runes add one or more weapon damage
dice to your damage roll. These extra dice are the
same die size as the weapon’s damage die. At higher
levels, most characters also gain extra damage from
weapon specialization.
Critical Hits
When you make a Strike with a weapon or unarmed
attack and succeed with a natural 20 (the number on
the die is 20), or if the result of your attack exceeds the
target’s AC by 10, you achieve a critical success (also
known as a critical hit). If you critically succeed at a
Strike (page 418), your attack deals double damage.
Unarmed Attacks
Almost all characters start out trained in unarmed
attacks. You can Strike with your fist or another body
part, calculating your attack and damage rolls in the
same way you would with a weapon. Unarmed attacks
can belong to a weapon group (page 276), and they
might have weapon traits (page 276). However, unarmed
attacks aren’t weapons, and effects and abilities that
work with weapons never work with unarmed attacks
unless they specifically say so.
The Unarmed Attacks table (page 277) lists the
statistics for an unarmed attack with a fist, though you’ll
usually use the same statistics for attacks made with
any other parts of your body. Certain ancestry feats,
class features, and spells give access to special, more
powerful unarmed attacks. For instance, goblins with
the razortooth heritage can attack with their sharp jaws.
While most unarmed attacks are melee, some, especially
those from certain ancestries, might even be ranged, like
the leshy’s ability to launch hard seedpods. Details for
those unarmed attacks are provided in the abilities that
grant them.
Improvised Weapons
If you attack with something that wasn’t built to be a
weapon, such as a chair or a vase, you’re making an
attack with an improvised weapon. Improvised weapons
are simple weapons. You take a –2 item penalty to attack
rolls with an improvised weapon. The GM determines
the amount and type of damage the attack deals, if any,
as well as any weapon traits that the improvised weapon
should have.
Weapon Statistics
The tables on pages 277–281 list the statistics for various
melee and ranged weapons that you can purchase, as well
as the statistics for striking with a fist (or another basic
unarmed attack). The tables present the following statistics.
All weapons listed in this chapter have an item level of 0.
Damage
This entry lists the weapon’s damage die and the type of
damage it deals: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S
for slashing.

DAMAGE DICE

Each weapon lists the damage die used for its damage
roll. A standard weapon deals one die of damage, but a
magical striking rune can increase the number of dice
rolled, as can some special actions and spells. These
additional dice use the same die size as the weapon or
unarmed attack’s normal damage die.
Counting Damage Dice
Effects based on a weapon’s number of damage dice
include only the weapon’s damage die plus any extra dice
from a striking rune. They don’t count extra dice from
abilities, critical specialization effects, property runes,
weapon traits, or the like.

Increasing Die Size

When an effect calls on you to increase the size of your
weapon damage dice, instead of using its normal weapon
damage dice, use the next larger die, as listed below (so if
you were using a d4, you’d use a d6, and so on). If you are
already using a d12, the size is already at its maximum.
You can’t increase your weapon damage die size more
than once.

1d4 » 1d6 » 1d8 » 1d10 » 1d12

Range
Ranged and thrown weapons have a range increment.
Attacks with these weapons work normally up to
that distance. Attack rolls beyond a weapon’s range
increment take a –2 penalty for each additional multiple
of that increment between you and the target. Attacks
beyond the sixth range increment are impossible.
For example, a shortbow takes no penalty against a
target up to 60 feet away, a –2 penalty against a target
beyond 60 feet but up to 120 feet away, and a –4 penalty
against a target beyond 120 feet but up to 180 feet away,
and so on, up to 360 feet.
Reload
While all weapons need some amount of time to get into
position, many ranged weapons also need to be loaded
and reloaded. This entry indicates how many Interact
actions it takes to reload such weapons or draw certain
thrown weapons, like shuriken. This can be 0 if drawing

ammunition and firing or throwing the weapon are part
of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to
reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed
together as an activity, or you can spend some of those
actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn.
An item with an entry of “—” must be drawn to be
thrown, which usually takes an Interact action just like
drawing any other weapon. Reloading a ranged weapon
and drawing a thrown weapon both require a free hand.
Switching your grip to free a hand and then to place your
hands in the grip necessary to wield the weapon are both
included in the actions you spend to reload a weapon.
Bulk
This entry gives the weapon’s Bulk. A weapon’s Bulk is
increased or decreased if it’s sized for creatures that aren’t
Small or Medium size, following the rules on page 270.
Hands
Some weapons require one hand to wield, and others
require two. A few items, such as a longbow, list 1+
for its Hands entry. You can hold a weapon with a 1+
entry in one hand, but the process of shooting it requires
using a second to retrieve, nock, and loose an arrow.
This means you can do things with your free hand while
holding the bow without changing your grip, but the
other hand must be free when you shoot. To properly
wield a 1+ weapon, you must hold it in one hand and
also have a hand free.
Weapons requiring two hands typically deal more
damage. Some one-handed weapons have the two-hand
trait, causing them to deal a different size of weapon
damage die when used in two hands. In addition, some
abilities require you to wield a weapon in two hands.
You meet this requirement while holding the weapon in
two hands, even if it doesn’t require two hands or have
the two-hand trait.
If an action or other ability requires you to use a
“two-handed weapon,” it applies for any weapon you
wield in two hands. Any permanent adjustments to the

weapon, such as a rune that can be added to a “one-
handed weapon,” uses the Hands entry in the weapon

table exactly (1+ counts as one-handed for this purpose).
Group
A weapon or unarmed attack’s group classifies it with
similar weapons. Groups affect some abilities and what
the weapon does on a critical hit if you have the critical
specialization benefits for that weapon or unarmed
attack; for full details, see page 283.
Weapon Traits
The traits a weapon or unarmed attack has are listed in
this entry. Any trait that refers to a “weapon” can also
apply to an unarmed attack that has that trait. Traits are
described on page 282.

Ammunition
Some entries in the ranged weapons tables are followed
by an entry for the type of ammunition that weapon
launches. The damage die is determined by the weapon,

not the ammunition. Because that and other relevant
statistics vary by weapon, ammunition entries list only
the name, quantity, Price, and Bulk. Using ammunition
destroys it.

Weapon Traits
Weapons and unarmed attacks can have these traits.
Weapons crafted and used by a given ancestry (such as the
elven curve blade) often have the trait for that ancestry.
Agile: The multiple attack penalty you take with this
weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead
of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent
attacks in the turn.
Attached: An attached weapon must be combined with
another piece of gear to be used. The trait lists what type
of item the weapon must be attached to. You must be
wielding or wearing the item the weapon is attached to
in order to attack with it. For example, shield spikes are
attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes
instead of a shield bash. An attached weapon is usually
bolted onto or built into the item it’s attached to, and
typically an item can have only one weapon attached to
it. An attached weapon can be affixed to an item with 10
minutes of work and a successful DC 10 Crafting check;
this includes the time needed to remove the weapon from
a previous item, if necessary. If an item is destroyed, its
attached weapon can usually be salvaged.
Backstabber: When you hit an off-guard creature, this
weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its normal
damage. The precision damage increases to 2 if the weapon
is a +3 weapon.
Backswing: You can use the momentum from a missed
attack with this weapon to lead into your next attack.
After missing with this weapon on your turn, you gain a +1
circumstance bonus to your next attack with this weapon
before the end of your turn.
Concealable: This weapon is designed to be
inconspicuous or easily concealed. You gain a +2
circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide or
conceal a weapon with this trait.
Deadly: On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon
damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the
weapon’s damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon
has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has
a major striking rune. For instance, a rapier with a greater
striking rune deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical
hit. An ability that changes the size of the weapon’s normal
damage dice doesn’t change the size of its deadly die.
Disarm: You can use this weapon to Disarm with the
Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This
uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and
adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as
an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically
fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop
the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a
critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free
hand if you want to take the item.
Fatal: The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit,
the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size instead
of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional
damage die of the listed size.

Finesse: You can use your Dexterity modifier instead
of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee
weapon. You still calculate damage using Strength.
Forceful: This weapon becomes more dangerous as you
build momentum. When you attack with it more than
once on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance
bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage
dice, and each later attack gains a circumstance bonus to
damage equal to double the number of damage dice.
Free-Hand: This weapon doesn’t take up your hand,
usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand
weapon can’t be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered
by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform
manipulate actions, and so on. You can’t attack with a
free-hand weapon if you’re wielding anything in that hand
or otherwise using that hand. When you’re not wielding
anything and not otherwise using the hand, you can use
abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those
that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand. Each
of your hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it.
Grapple: You can use this weapon to Grapple with the
Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses
the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds
the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to
the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple
using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the
effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.
Jousting: The weapon is suited for mounted combat
with a harness or similar means. When mounted, if you
moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack,
add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal
to the number of damage dice for the weapon. In addition,
while mounted, you can wield the weapon in one hand,
changing the damage die to the listed value. As a part of
your action to Mount a creature, you can switch your grip
on a jousting weapon to one-handed. After that, changing
your grip takes the same actions described on page 268.

If you dismount while wielding a jousting weapon one-
handed, you can switch to using two hands as part of that

action if you have a hand free at that point. If not, you’ll
still be holding the weapon in one hand, but not wielding it.
Monk: Many monks learn to use these weapons. The
monk class appears in Player Core 2.
Nonlethal: Attacks with this weapon are nonlethal (page
407), and are used to knock creatures unconscious instead
of kill them. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a
lethal attack with a –2 circumstance penalty.
Parry: This weapon can be used defensively to block
attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency
with it is trained or better, you can spend a single action
to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1
circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.
Propulsive: You add half your Strength modifier (if
positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon.
If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full
Strength modifier instead.
Ranged Trip: The weapon can be used to Trip with the
Athletics skill within the weapon’s first range increment.
The skill check takes a –2 circumstance penalty. You can
add the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to
the check. A ranged trip weapon doesn’t deal any damage
when used to Trip. These weapons are usually thrown.
Reach: This weapon can be used to attack enemies up to
10 feet away instead of only adjacent enemies. For creatures
with reach, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.
Shove: You can use this weapon to Shove with the
Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses
the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds
the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus
to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove
using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the
effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.
Sweep: This weapon makes wide swinging attacks. When
you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack
a different target this turn using this weapon.
Thrown: You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack;
it is a ranged weapon when thrown. You add your Strength
modifier to damage as you would for a melee weapon.
When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes
the range increment. Ranged weapons with this trait use
the range increment in the weapon’s Range entry.
Trip: You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics
skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the
weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the
weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the
Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using
the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of
a failure instead of a critical failure.
Twin: These weapons are used as a pair. When you attack
with a twin weapon, you add a circumstance bonus to the
damage roll equal to the weapon’s number of damage dice
if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of
the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same
type, but they don’t need to have the same runes.
Two-Hand: This weapon can be wielded with two hands
to change its weapon damage die to the indicated value.
This change applies to all the weapon’s damage dice.
Unarmed: An unarmed attack uses your body rather
than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn’t
a weapon, though has a weapon group and might have
weapon traits. An unarmed attack can’t be Disarmed. It
also doesn’t take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping
appendage generally works like a free-hand weapon.
Versatile: A versatile weapon can be used to deal a
different type of damage than its listed type. This trait
indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing
weapon with versatile S can deal piercing or slashing
damage. You choose the damage type each time you attack.
Volley: This ranged weapon is less effective at close
distances. Your attacks against targets that are at a distance
within the range listed take a –2 penalty.

Critical Specialization
Certain effects can grant you benefits when you make a
Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This
is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect
depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs
to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the
critical specialization effect of your weapon.
Axe: Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target
and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll
result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature
equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled
(including extra dice for its striking rune, if any). This
amount isn’t doubled, and no bonuses or other additional
dice apply to this damage.
Bomb: Increase the radius of the bomb’s splash damage
(if any) to 10 feet.
Bow: If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a
surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The
target is immobilized and must spend an Interact action
to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check to pull the missile free;
it can’t move from its space until it succeeds. The creature
doesn’t become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid, or could
otherwise escape without effort (such as by being large
enough that the missile would not be an impediment.)
Brawling: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save
against your class DC or be slowed 1 until the end of your
next turn.
Club: You knock the target up to 10 feet in a straight
line away from you, in a direction of your choice. This is
forced movement (page 422).
Crossbow: The target takes 1d8 persistent bleed damage.
You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the
weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls.
Dart: The target takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage.
You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the
weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls.
Flail: The target is knocked prone unless they succeed at
a Reflex save against your class DC.
Hammer: The target is knocked prone unless they
succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC.
Knife: The target takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage.
You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the
weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls.
Pick: The weapon viciously pierces the target, who takes
2 additional damage per weapon damage die.
Polearm: The target is moved 5 feet in a direction of
your choice. This is forced movement (page 422).
Shield: You knock the target back from you 5 feet. This
is forced movement (page 422).
Sling: The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against
your class DC or be stunned 1.
Spear: Weapons of this type pierce the target, weakening
its attacks. The target is clumsy 1 until the start of your
next turn.
Sword: The target is made off-balance by your attack,
becoming off-guard until the start of your next turn.
Weapon Descriptions
Each of the weapons listed in the weapon tables (pages
277–281) are described below.
Alchemical Bomb: These bombs come in a variety of
types and levels of power, but no matter the variety, you
throw the bomb at the target and it explodes, unleashing
its alchemical blast (page 292).
Arbalest: This large and well-made crossbow requires
some training to use effectively, but it’s assembled with a
cutting-edge firing mechanism that maximizes its speed,
power, and accuracy.
Arrow: These projectiles are the ammunition for bows.
The shaft of an arrow is made of wood. It is stabilized in
flight by fletching at one end and bears a metal head on
the other.
Bastard Sword: This broad-bladed sword, sometimes
called the hand-and-a-half sword, has a longer grip so
it can be held in one hand or used with two hands to
provide extra slashing power.
Battle Axe: These axes are designed explicitly as
weapons, rather than tools. They typically weigh less,
with a shaft reinforced with metal bands or bolts, and
have a sharper blade, making them ideal for chopping
limbs rather than wood.
Blowgun Dart: These thin, light darts are typically made
of hardwood and stabilized with fletching of down or fur.
They are often hollow so they can be used to deliver poison.
Blowgun: This long, narrow tube is used for shooting
blowgun darts, using only the power of a forcefully
exhaled breath.
Bo Staff: This strong but slender staff is tapered at the
ends and well balanced. It’s designed to be an offensive
and defensive weapon.
Bola: This throwing weapon consists of weights tied to
the end of long cords, which can be used to bludgeon foes
or entangle their legs.
Bolt: Shorter than traditional arrows but similar in
construction, bolts are the ammunition used by crossbows.
Clan Dagger: This broad dagger is carried by dwarves
as a weapon, tool, and designation of clan. Losing or
having to surrender a clan dagger is considered a mark of
embarrassment to most dwarves.
Club: This is a piece of stout wood shaped or repurposed
to bludgeon an enemy. Clubs can be intricately carved
pieces of martial art or as simple as a tree branch or piece
of wood.
Composite Longbow: This projectile weapon is made
from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together to increase
the power of its pull and the force of its projectile. Like
all longbows, its great size also increases the bow’s range
and power. You must use two hands to fire it, and it cannot
be used while mounted. Any time an ability is specifically
restricted to a longbow, such as Erastil’s favored weapon, it
also applies to composite longbows unless otherwise stated.
Composite Shortbow: This shortbow is made from horn,
wood, and sinew laminated together to increase the power

of its pull and the force of its projectile. Its compact size
and power make it a favorite of mounted archers. Any time
an ability is specifically restricted to a shortbow, it also
applies to composite shortbows unless otherwise stated.
Crossbow: This ranged weapon has a bow-like assembly
mounted on a handled frame called a tiller. The tiller has
a mechanism to lock the bowstring in place, attached to a
trigger mechanism that releases the tension and launches
a bolt.
Dagger: This small, bladed weapon is held in one hand
and used to stab a creature in close combat. It can also
be thrown.
Dart: This thrown weapon is larger than an arrow but
shorter than a javelin. It typically has a short shaft of
wood ending in a metal tip and is sometimes stabilized
by feathers or fur.
Dogslicer: This short, curved, and crude makeshift
blade often has holes drilled into it to reduce its weight.
It’s a favored weapon of goblins.
Dwarven Waraxe: This favored weapon of the dwarves
has a large, ornate head mounted on a thick handle. This
powerful axe can be wielded with one hand or two.
Elven Curve Blade: Essentially a longer version of the
scimitar, this traditional elven weapon has a thinner blade
than its cousin.
Falchion: This weapon is a heavier, two-handed version
of the curved-bladed scimitar. It is weighted toward the
blade’s end, making it a powerful slashing weapon.
Filcher’s Fork: This halfling weapon looks like a long,
two-pronged fork and is used as both a weapon and a
cooking implement.
Flail: This weapon consists of a wooden handle
attached to a spiked ball or cylinder by a chain, rope, or
strap of leather.
Gauntlet: A pair of these metal gloves comes with
full plate, half plate, and splint armor; they can also be
purchased separately and worn with other types of armor.
They not only protect your hands but also transform your
hands into lethal weapons.
Glaive: This polearm consists of a long, single-edged
blade on the end of a 7-foot pole. It is extremely effective
at delivering lethal cuts at a distance.
Gnome Flickmace: More a flail than a mace, this
weapon has a short handle attached to a length of chain
with a ball at the end. The ball is propelled to its reach
with the flick of the wrist, the momentum of which brings
the ball back to the wielder after the strike.
Gnome Hooked Hammer: This gnome tool and weapon
features a hammer at one end and a curved pick on the
other. It’s such a strange and awkward weapon that others
think the gnomes are slightly erratic for using it.
Greataxe: This large battle axe is too heavy to wield
with only one hand. Many greataxes incorporate
two blades, and they are often “bearded,” having a
hook at the bottom to increase the strength of their
chopping power.
Greatclub: While many greatclubs are intricately
carved, others are little more than a sturdy tree branch.
These massive clubs are too heavy to wield with only
one hand.
Greatpick: This pick has a longer handle and broader
head than a regular pick. It is too heavy to wield in
one hand.
Greatsword: This immense two-handed sword is nearly
as tall as its wielder. Its lower blade is often somewhat
dulled to allow it to be gripped for extra leverage in
close-quarter fights.
Guisarme: This polearm bears a long, often one-sided,
curved blade with a hook protruding from the blunt side
of the blade, which can allow its wielder to trip opponents
at a distance. Its shaft is usually 8 feet long.
Halberd: This polearm has a relatively short, 5-foot
shaft. The business end is a long spike with an axe
blade attached.
Halfling Sling Staff: This staff ends in a Y-shaped
split that cradles a sling. The length of the staff provides
excellent leverage when used two-handed to fling rocks or
bullets from the sling.
Hand Crossbow: Sometimes referred to as an alley bow
by rogues or ruffians, this small crossbow fires small bolts
that are sometimes used to deliver poison to the target. It’s
small enough to be shot one-handed, but it still requires
two hands to load.
Hatchet: This small axe can be used in close combat
or thrown.
Heavy Crossbow: This large crossbow is harder to
load and more substantial than a regular crossbow, but it
packs a greater punch.
Horsechopper: Created by goblins to battle horses, this
weapon is essentially a long shaft ending in a blade with
a large hook.
Javelin: This thin spear is well balanced for throwing
but is not designed for melee use.
Kama: Similar to a sickle and used in some regions to
reap grain, a kama has a short, slightly curved blade and
a wooden handle.
Katana: A katana is a curved, single-edged sword
known for its wickedly sharped blade.
Katar: Also known as punching daggers, katars are
characterized by their H-shaped hand grip that allows the
blade to jut out from the knuckles.
Khakkara: This staff is topped by a pointed metal circle
from which hang several smaller rings that jingle and clang
noisily as the staff is moved, allowing you to announce
your presence and scare off wild animals as you walk.
Kukri: The blade of this foot-long knife curves inward
and lacks a cross guard at the hilt.
Lance: This spear-like weapon is used by a mounted
creature to deal a great deal of damage.
Light Hammer: This smaller version of the warhammer
has a wooden or metal shaft ending in a metal head.
Unlike its heavier cousin, it is light enough to throw.

Light Mace: A light mace has a short wooden or metal
shaft ending with a dense metal head. Used much like a
club, it delivers heavy bludgeoning blows, but with extra
power derived from the head’s metal ridges or spikes.
Light Pick: A light pick is a modified mining implement
with a wooden shaft ending in a pick head crafted more
to pierce armor and flesh than chip rocks.
Longbow: This 5-foot-tall bow, usually made of a
single piece of elm, hickory, or yew, has a powerful draw
and is excellent at propelling arrows with great force and
at an extreme distance. You must use two hands to fire a
longbow, and it can’t be used while mounted.
Longspear: This very long spear, sometimes called a pike,
is purely for thrusting rather than throwing. Used by many
soldiers and city watch for crowd control and defense against
charging enemies, it must be wielded with two hands.
Longsword: Longswords, also known as arming swords,
can be one-edged or two-edged swords. Their blades are
heavy and they’re between 3 and 4 feet in length.
Mace: With a stout haft and a heavy metal head, a
mace is sturdy and allows its wielder to deliver powerful
blows and dent armor.
Main-Gauche: This parrying dagger features a robust
guard to protect the wielder’s hand.
Maul: Mauls are massive warhammers that must be
swung with two hands.
Morningstar: This weapon has a short shaft ending in
a metal ball studded with spikes.
Nunchaku: The nunchaku is constructed of two
wooden or metal bars connected by a short length of rope
or chain.
Orc Knuckle Dagger: This stout, metal blade of orc
design has a horizontal basket hilt with blades jutting
from each end, or sometimes one blade like that of a katar.
Orc Necksplitter: This single-bladed bearded axe has
a jagged blade that’s perfect for separating bone from
tendon and cartilage.
Pick: A pick designed solely for combat has a sturdy
wooden shaft and a heavy, pointed head to deliver
devastating blows.
Ranseur: This polearm is a long trident with a central
prong that’s longer than the other two.
Rapier: The rapier is a long and thin piercing blade with
a basket hilt. It is prized among many as a dueling weapon.
Sai: This piercing dagger is a metal spike flanked by a
pair of prongs that can be used to trap an enemy’s weapon.
Sap: A sap has a soft wrapping around a dense core,
typically a leather sheath around a lead rod. Its head is
wider than its grip to disperse the force of a blow, as the
weapon’s purpose is to knock out its victim rather than
to draw blood.
Sawtooth Saber: The signature weapon of the Red
Mantis assassins, this curved blade is serrated like a saw,
hence the name.
Scimitar: This one-handed curved blade is sharp on
one side.
Scythe: Derived from a farming tool used to mow
down long grains and cereals, this weapon has a long
wooden shaft with protruding handles, capped with a
curved blade set at a right angle.
Shield Bash: A shield bash is not actually a weapon, but
a maneuver in which you thrust or swing your shield to
hit your foe with an impromptu attack.
Shield Boss: Typically a round, convex, or conical piece
of thick metal attached to the center of a shield, a shield
boss increases the bludgeoning damage of a shield bash.
Shield Spikes: These metal spikes are strategically
placed on the defensive side of the shield to deal piercing
damage with a shield bash.
Shortbow: This smaller bow is made of a single piece of
wood and favored by skirmishers and cavalry.
Shortsword: These blades come in a variety of shapes
and styles, but they are typically 2 feet long.
Shuriken: This “throwing star” is a small piece of flat
metal with sharp edges, designed to be flung with a flick
of the wrist.
Sickle: Originally a farming tool used for reaping grain,
this one-handed weapon has a short wooden handle ending
in a curved blade, sometimes sharpened on both sides.
Sling: Little more than a leather cup attached to a pair
of straps, a sling can be used to fling smooth stones or
sling bullets at a range.
Sling Bullet: These are small metal balls, typically
either iron or lead, designed to be used as ammunition
in slings.
Spear: A long metal shaft ending with a metal spike, a
spear can be used one-handed as a melee weapon and can
be thrown.
Spiked Chain: This 4-foot-long length of chain is
covered with barbs and has spikes on one or both ends.
Some feature metal hoops used as handgrips.

Spiked Gauntlet: Providing the same defensive function
as a standard gauntlet, this version has a group of spikes
protruding from the knuckles.
Staff: This long piece of wood can aid in walking and
deliver a mighty blow.
Starknife: From a central metal ring, four tapering
metal blades extend like points on a compass rose. When
gripping a starknife from the center, the wielder can use it
as a melee weapon. It can also be thrown short distances.
Sword Cane: This slender, rapier-like sword is concealed
within a wooden or metal cane that serves as a sheath,
making it an inconspicuous weapon easy to slip past
inspections or into high-society events. A sword cane is
typically 4 feet long when sheathed, and its hilt is usually
capped with a wooden or metal decoration.
Temple Sword: This heavy blade is favored by guardians
of religious sites. It has a distinctive, crescent-shaped blade
that seems to be a mix of a sickle and sword. It often has
holes drilled into the blade or the pommel so that bells or
other holy trinkets can be affixed to the weapon.
Trident: This three-pronged, spear-like weapon typically
has a 4-foot shaft. Like a spear, it can be wielded with one
hand or thrown.
Wakizashi: This short-bladed, single-edged sword is
typically carried as part of a pair alongside a katana.
War Flail: This large flail has a long shaft connected to
a shorter piece of stout wood or metal that’s sometimes
inlaid with spikes.
Warhammer: This weapon has a wooden shaft ending
in a large, heavy metal head. The head of the hammer
might be single-sided or double-sided, but it’s always
capable of delivering powerful bludgeoning blows.
Whip: This long strand of thick leather, often braided,
delivers a painful but nonlethal slash at a distance, usually
accompanied by a distinctive cracking sound.
GEAR
Your character needs all sorts of items both while exploring and in downtime, ranging from
rations to climbing gear to fancy clothing, depending on the situation.
Gear Statistics
The table on page 291 lists Price and Bulk entries for
a wide variety of gear. Any item with a number after it
in parentheses indicates that the item’s Price is for the
indicated quantity, though the Bulk entry for such an
item is the value for only one such item. All items in this
chapter are level 0 unless the item name is followed by a
higher item level in parentheses.
Hands
This lists how many hands it takes to use the item
effectively. Most items that require two hands can be
carried in only one hand, but you must spend an Interact
action to change your grip in order to use the item. The
GM may determine that an item is too big to carry in one
hand (or even two hands, for particularly large items).
Wearing Toolkits
You can make a toolkit (such as an alchemist’s toolkit
or healer’s toolkit) easier to use by wearing it. This easy
access allows you to draw and replace the tools within
as part of the action that uses them, rather than needing
to Interact to draw them. You can wear up to 2 Bulk of
toolkits in this manner; any beyond this limit must be
stowed or drawn with an Interact action to use.
Adventuring Gear
These items follow special rules or require more detail.
Adventurer’s Pack: This item is the starter kit
for an adventurer, containing the essential items for
exploration and survival. The Bulk value is for the entire
pack together, but see the descriptions of individual
items as necessary.
The pack contains the following items: a backpack,
a bedroll, 10 pieces of chalk, flint and steel, 50 feet of
rope, 2 weeks’ rations, soap, 5 torches, and a waterskin.
Alchemist’s Lab: You need an alchemist’s lab to
Craft alchemical items during downtime. An expanded
alchemist’s lab gives a +1 item bonus to Crafting checks
to create alchemical items.
Alchemist’s Toolkit: This mobile collection of vials
and chemicals can be used for simple alchemical tasks.
If you wear your alchemist’s toolkit, you can draw and
replace them as part of the action that uses them.
Artisan’s Toolkit: You need this toolkit to create
items from raw materials with the Craft skill. A
sterling artisan’s toolkit gives you a +1 item bonus to
the check. Different sets are needed for different work,
as determined by the GM; for example, a blacksmith’s
toolkit differs from a woodworker’s toolkit. If you wear
your artisan’s toolkit, you can draw and replace it as
part of the action that uses it.
Backpack: A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items,
and the first 2 Bulk of these items don’t count against
your Bulk limits. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack
rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light
instead of negligible.
Basic Crafter’s Book: This book contains formulas
(page 294) for Crafting the 0-level common items in
this chapter.
Brass Ear: A brass ear is a short, flared tube with
one end narrow enough to comfortably fit against
the ear canal. When using it to listen through a door,
window, thin wall, or similar barrier, if the barrier would
normally increase the DC of your Perception check to
hear sounds on the other side, the DC increases by only
half as much as normal. It’s not suitable for improving
your hearing in general, a role better served by a hearing
aid (page 293).
Caltrops: These four-pronged metal spikes can damage
a creature’s feet. You can scatter caltrops in an empty
square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first
creature that moves into that square must succeed at a
DC 14 Acrobatics check or take 1d4 piercing damage
and 1 persistent bleed damage. A creature taking
persistent bleed damage from caltrops takes a –5-foot
penalty to its Speed. Spending an Interact action to pluck
the caltrops free reduces the DC to stop the bleeding.
Once a creature takes damage from caltrops, enough are
ruined that other creatures moving into the square are
safe. Deployed caltrops can be salvaged and reused if no
creatures took damage from them. Otherwise, enough
are ruined that they can’t be salvaged.
Candle: A lit candle sheds dim light in a 10-foot
radius for 8 hours.
Chest: A wooden chest can hold up to 8 Bulk of items.
Climbing Kit: This satchel includes 50 feet of rope,
pulleys, a dozen pitons, a hammer, a grappling hook,
and one set of crampons. Climbing kits allow you to
attach yourself to the wall you’re Climbing, moving half
as quickly as usual (minimum 5 feet) but letting you
attempt a DC 5 flat check whenever you critically fail
to prevent a fall. You gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics
checks to Climb while using an extreme climbing kit.
A single kit has only enough materials for one climber;
each climber needs their own kit. If you wear your
climbing kit, you can access it as part of a Climb action.
Clothing: Ordinary clothing is functional with
basic tailoring, such as peasant garb, monk’s robes, or
work clothes.
Explorer’s clothing is sturdy enough that it can be
reinforced to protect you, even though it isn’t a suit of
armor. It comes in many forms, though the most common
resemble clerical vestments, monk’s garments, or wizard’s
robes, as members of these classes likely avoid wearing
armor. For more information on explorer’s clothing, see
pages 272–273. More expensive finery or clothes for specific
climes cost more.
Compass: A compass helps you Sense Direction or
navigate, provided you’re in a location with uniform
magnetic fields. Without a compass, you take a –2 item
penalty to these checks (similar to using a shoddy item). A
lensatic compass gives you a +1 item bonus to these checks.
Concealed Sheath: This leather sheath is large enough
to hold an item of up to light Bulk and is typically used
for daggers, wands, thieves’ toolkits, and similar objects.
You can affix it to the inside of a boot, under a bracer or
sleeve, or in other inconspicuous locations to gain a +1
item bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal
the item within.
Crowbar: When Forcing Open an object that doesn’t
have an easy grip, a crowbar makes it easier to gain the
necessary leverage. Without a crowbar, prying something
open takes a –2 item penalty to the Athletics check to
Force Open. A levered crowbar grants you a +1 item
bonus to Athletics checks to Force Open anything that
can be pried open.
Detective’s Kit: This leather satchel contains empty
vials, a pair of tweezers, a supply of small linen
cloths, a set of brass calipers and a knotted string for
measuring distances, several pieces of chalk, a pen, and
a blank notebook for keeping notes. Every component
of a detective’s kit is of exceeding quality, and thus
a detective’s kit adds a +1 item bonus to checks to
investigate a crime scene, a clue, or similar details. Like
other tool kits, a detective’s kit uses one hand if wearing
the kit and two hands otherwise.
Disguise Kit: This small wooden box contains
cosmetics, false facial hair, spirit gum, and a few simple
wigs. You usually need a disguise kit to set up a disguise
in order to Impersonate someone using the Deception
skill. An elite disguise kit adds a +1 item bonus to relevant
checks. If you’ve crafted a large number of disguises, you
can replenish your cosmetics supply with replacement
cosmetics suitable for the type of your disguise kit. You
can draw and replace a worn disguise kit as part of the
action that uses it.
Dueling Cape: You can pull a dueling cape you’re
wearing from your shoulder and wrap it around your
arm with an Interact action. While wielding the dueling
cape this way, the cape uses that arm and hand, and
you can’t hold anything else in that hand. While you do
so, you can spend an action to hold it in a protective
position, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC
and to Deception checks to Feint until the start of your
next turn.

Fishing Tackle: This kit include a collapsible fishing
pole, fishhooks, line, lures, and a fishing net. Professional
fishing tackle grants a +1 item bonus to checks to fish.
Flint and Steel: Flint and steel are useful in creating a
fire if you have the time to catch a spark, though using
them is typically too time-consuming to be practical
during an encounter. Even in ideal conditions, using flint
and steel to light a flame requires using at least 3 actions,
and often significantly longer.
Formula Book: A formula book holds the formulas
necessary to make items other than the common
equipment from this chapter; characters of the alchemist
class (Player Core 2) typically get one for free. Each
formula book can hold the formulas for up to 100
different items. Formulas can also appear on parchment
sheets, tablets, and almost any other medium; there’s no
need for you to copy them into a specific book as long as
you can keep them on hand to reference them.
Grappling Hook: You can throw a grappling hook
with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor
a grappling hook, make a ranged attack roll using your
simple weapon proficiency against a DC depending on
the target, typically at least DC 20. This attack has the
secret trait. On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but
on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but
actually falls when you’re partway up.
Healer’s Toolkits: This kit of bandages, herbs, and
suturing tools is necessary for Medicine checks to
Administer First Aid, Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or
Treat Wounds. Expanded healer’s toolkits provide a +1
item bonus to such checks. If you wear your healer’s
toolkit, you can draw and replace them as part of the
action that uses them.
Lantern: A lantern sheds bright light and requires 1
pint of oil to function for 6 hours. A bull’s-eye lantern
emits its light in a 60-foot cone (and dim light in the
next 60 feet). A hooded lantern sheds light in a 30-foot
radius (and dim light in the next 30 feet) and is equipped
with shutters, which you can close to block the light.
Closing or opening the shutters takes an Interact action.
Lock: Picking a poor lock requires two successful DC
15 Thievery checks, a simple lock requires three successful
DC 20 Thievery checks, an average lock requires four
successes at DC 25, a good lock requires five successes at
DC 30, and a superior lock six successes at DC 40.
Magnifying Glass: This quality handheld lens gives
you a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to notice
minute details of documents, fabric, and the like.
Manacles: You can manacle someone who is willing or
otherwise at your mercy as an exploration activity taking
10–30 seconds depending on the creature’s size and how
many manacles you apply. A two-legged creature with its
legs bound takes a –15-foot circumstance penalty to its
Speeds, and a two-handed creature with its wrists bound
has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check any time it uses a
manipulate action or else that action fails. This DC
may be higher depending on how tightly the manacles
constrain the hands. A creature bound to a stationary
object is immobilized. For creatures with more or fewer
limbs, the GM determines what effect manacles have,
if any. Freeing a creature from poor manacles requires
two successful DC 17 Thievery checks, simple manacles
requires three successes at DC 22, average manacles
require four successes at DC 27, good manacles require
five successes at DC 32, and superior manacles require
six successes at DC 42.
Musical Instrument: Handheld instruments include
bagpipes, a small set of chimes, small drums, fiddles and
viols, flutes and recorders, small harps, lutes, trumpets,
and similarly sized instruments. The GM might rule that
an especially large handheld instrument (like a tuba) has
greater Bulk. Heavy instruments such as large drums,
a full set of chimes, and keyboard instruments are less
portable and generally need to be stationary while
being played.
A virtuoso instrument is more finely made and
gives a +1 item bonus to Performance checks using
that instrument.
Net: You can use a net either on its own or attached to a
rope. When attached to a rope, you can use the net to Grapple
a Medium or smaller creature up to 10 feet away (instead
of only adjacent creatures). You can continue to Grapple to
keep your hold on the target so long as the target remains
within 10 feet and you continue to hold the net. The grabbed
creature gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Escape unless you
are adjacent to them, and it can attempt a DC 16 Athletics
check to Force Open the net entirely. Once the target is no
longer grabbed, the net is unwieldy until refolded with an
Interact action with the concentrate trait that requires two
hands; if used without being refolded, Grapple checks made
with the net take a –2 penalty.
When the net is unattached, you can attempt a ranged
attack roll using your simple weapon proficiency against
a Medium or smaller creature within 20 feet. On a hit,
the target is off-guard and takes a –10-foot circumstance
penalty to its Speeds until it Escapes, and on a critical hit, it’s
also immobilized until it Escapes. The Escape DC is 16. A
creature adjacent to the target can Interact to remove the net.
Oil: You can use oil to fuel lanterns, but you can also
set a pint of oil aflame and throw it. You must first spend
an Interact action preparing the oil, then throw it with
another action as a ranged attack. If you hit, it splatters
on the creature or in a single 5-foot square you target.
You must succeed at a DC 10 flat check for the oil to
ignite successfully when it hits. If the oil ignites, the
target takes 1d6 fire damage.
Parrying Scabbard: You can draw this reinforced
sheath during the same Interact action you use to draw
the weapon it holds, wielding the weapon in one hand
and the scabbard in your other. A parrying scabbard
can be used for your defense much like a weapon with
the parry trait: you can spend an action to position it

defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC
until the start of your next turn. Parrying scabbards are
available for any sword that can be wielded in one hand.
Periscope: This is a 2-foot-long tube with two angled
mirrors, one at each end. When the mirrors are aligned
correctly, you can look around obstacles while remaining
behind cover. This doesn’t provide a sufficient line of
effect to target creatures around corners.
Piton: These small spikes can be used as anchors to
make climbing easier. To affix a piton, you must hold it
in one hand and use a hammer to drive it in with your
other hand. You can attach a rope to the hammered
piton so that you don’t fall all the way to the ground on
a critical failure while Climbing.
Primal Symbol: Primal spellcasters, especially druids,
often wear adornments of natural materials to symbolize
their connection to nature, such as rings of woven plants,
tokens made from animal parts, or other symbols related
to a druidic order or nature philosophy.
Religious Symbol: This piece of wood or silver is
emblazoned with an image representing a deity. Some
divine spellcasters, such as clerics, can use a religious
symbol to use certain abilities. A religious symbol can be
worn on the body on a chain or pin, or can be held.
Religious Text: This manuscript contains scripture of
a particular religion. Some divine spellcasters, such as
clerics, can use a religious text to use certain abilities. A
religious text must be held in one hand to use it.
Repair Toolkit: A repair toolkit allows you to perform
simple repairs while traveling. It contains a portable
anvil, tongs, woodworking tools, a whetstone, and oils
for conditioning leather and wood. You can use a repair
toolkit to Repair items using the Crafting skill. A superb
repair kit gives you a +1 item bonus to the check. You
can draw and replace a worn repair toolkit as part of the
action that uses it.
Sack: A sack can hold up to 8 Bulk worth of items. A
sack containing 2 Bulk or less can be worn on the body,
usually tucked into a belt. You can carry a sack with one
hand, but must use two hands to transfer items in and out.
Saddlebags: Saddlebags come in a pair. Each can hold
up to 3 Bulk of items, and the first 1 Bulk of items in
each doesn’t count against your mount’s Bulk limit. The
Bulk value given is for saddlebags worn by a mount. If
you are carrying or stowing saddlebags, they count as 1
Bulk instead of light Bulk.
Scholarly Journal: Scholarly journals are uncommon.
Each scholarly journal is a folio on a very specific
topic, such as vampires or the history of a single town
or neighborhood of a city. If you spend 1 minute
referencing an academic journal before attempting a
skill check to Recall Knowledge about the subject, you
gain a +1 item bonus to the check. A compendium of
journals costs five times as much as a single journal and
requires both hands to use; each compendium contains
several journals and grants its bonus on a broader topic,
such as all undead or a whole city. The GM determines
what scholarly journals are available in any location.
Signal Whistle: When sounded, a signal whistle can be
heard clearly up to half a mile away across open terrain.
Spellbook: A spellbook holds the written knowledge
necessary to learn and prepare various spells, a necessity
for wizards (who typically get one for free) and a useful
luxury for other spellcasters looking to learn additional
spells. Each spellbook can hold up to 100 spells. The
Price listed is for a blank spellbook.
Spyglass: A typical spyglass lets you see eight times
farther than normal. A fine spyglass adds a +1 item bonus
to Perception checks to notice details at a distance.
Survey Map: Maps are uncommon. Most maps you
can find are simple and functional. A survey map details
a single location in excellent detail. One of these maps
gives you a +1 item bonus to Survival checks and any
skill checks to Recall Knowledge, provided the checks
are related to the location detailed on the map. Maps
sometimes come in atlases, containing a number of maps
of the same quality, often on similar topics. An atlas
costs five times as much as a single map and requires
both hands to use. The GM determines what maps are
available in any location.
Tack: Tack includes all the gear required to outfit a
riding animal, including a saddle, bit and bridle, and
stirrups if necessary. Especially large or oddly shaped
animals might require specialty saddles. These can be
more expensive or hard to find, as determined by the
GM. The Bulk value given is for tack worn by a creature.
If carried, the Bulk increases to 2.
Ten-Foot Pole: When wielding this long pole, you can
use Seek to search a square up to 10 feet away. The pole
is not sturdy enough to use as a weapon.
Thieves’ Toolkit: You need a thieves’ toolkit to Pick
Locks or Disable Devices (of some types) using the
Thievery skill. An infiltrator thieves’ toolkit adds a +1
item bonus to checks to Pick Locks and Disable Devices.
If your thieves’ toolkit is broken, you can repair it
by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks
appropriate to your toolkit; this doesn’t require using
the Repair action. If you wear your thieves’ toolkit, you
can draw and replace it as part of the action that uses it.
Tool: This entry is a catchall for basic hand tools that
don’t have a specific adventuring purpose. A hoe, shovel,
or sledgehammer is a long tool, and a hand drill, ice hook,
or trowel is a short tool. A tool can usually be used as an
improvised weapon, dealing 1d4 damage for a short tool
or 1d6 for a long tool. The GM determines the damage
type that’s appropriate or adjusts the damage if needed.
Torch: A torch sheds bright light in a 20-foot
radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) for 1 hour.
It can be used as an improvised weapon that deals 1d4
bludgeoning damage plus 1 fire damage.
Waterskin: When it’s full, a waterskin contains roughly
1 day’s worth of water for a Small or Medium creature.

Writing Set: Using a writing set, you can draft
correspondence and scribe scrolls. A set includes
stationery, including a variety of paper and parchment,
as well as ink, a quill or ink pen, sealing wax, and a
simple seal. If you’ve written a large amount, you can
refill your kit with extra ink and paper.

Alchemical Gear
The items listed on the Alchemical Gear table are the
most widely available alchemical items on Golarion,
which a 1st-level character could likely access. Each
item’s full entry appears in GM Core. Your GM might
allow you to start with other alchemical items from
there on a case-by-case basis.

* All these items have the alchemical and consumable
traits.
Alchemical Bombs
Alchemical bombs are consumable weapons that deal
damage or produce special effects, and they sometimes
deal splash damage. You throw a bomb as a ranged
Strike. It’s a martial ranged weapon with a range
increment of 20 feet and can’t benefit from runes since
it’s a consumable.
A bomb deals any listed splash damage to the target
on a failure, success, or critical success, and to all
other creatures within 5 feet of the target on a success
or critical success. Add the damage together before
applying resistance or weakness, and don’t multiply
splash damage on a critical hit.
Lesser Acid Flask: This alchemical bomb deals 1
acid damage, 1d6 persistent acid damage, and 1 acid
splash damage.
Lesser Alchemist’s Fire: This alchemical bomb deals
1d8 fire damage, 1 persistent fire damage, and 1 fire
splash damage.
Elixirs
Elixirs are alchemical items you drink with a single action
that has the manipulate trait, gaining the listed benefit.
Lesser Antidote: Gain a +2 item bonus to Fortitude
saves against poisons for 6 hours.
Lesser Antiplague: Gain a +2 item bonus to Fortitude
saves against diseases for 24 hours, including any daily
saves against a disease affliction.
Minor Elixir of Life: Regain 1d6 Hit Points and gain
a +1 item bonus to saving throws against diseases and
poisons for 10 minutes.
Alchemical Tools
Alchemical tools are a type of alchemical item you use,
rather than drink or throw. They all have the alchemical
and consumable traits.
Glow Rod: You can strike a glow rod on a hard surface
as an Interact action to cause it to shed bright light in a
20-foot radius (dim light in the next 20 feet) for 6 hours.
Lesser Smoke Ball: You create a 5-foot-radius
smokescreen centered on one corner of your space.
All creatures in the smoke are concealed and all other
creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1
minute or until dispersed by a strong wind.
Matchstick: You can use a matchstick to ignite
something flammable with a single Interact action, faster
than with flint and steel.
Assistive Items
Included in this section are assistive items for a variety
of disabilities. If a character has been disabled from
birth or for a significant period of time before setting
out on their adventure, they should begin with any basic
assistive items they require as part of their backstory.
These items don’t count against their starting money
(page 25), and any item granted in this way likewise has
no value when sold.

Cane: A cane is a straight length of wood with a
curved handle, shaped like the tip of a hook. Its simple
design helps with balance and only slightly assists with
taking weight off the affected opposite leg. The cane
is typically 2 to 3 feet long but can be lengthened or
shortened as needed.

Corrective Lenses: A set of corrective lenses might
take the form of eyeglasses or specialized goggles worn
over the eyes. You can don or remove your corrective
lenses as an Interact action.
Crutch: Crutches come as singles or as a pair depending
on how much support you need while walking. A crutch
fits under your armpit, and you use your hand and the
swing of your arm to move with them.
Hearing Aid: A hearing aid is worn in the ear and is
made from carved wood, shaped metal, or even small
clockwork pieces. The shape of the device aids those
who are hard of hearing, and you can wear one or
two depending on your hearing loss. You can attach or
remove your hearing aids as an Interact action.
A magical hearing aid has the magical trait. With its
curved shape, it hooks over the top and sits behind your
ear, with a receiver that fits into the ear opening. The
external part of the device detects sound waves and,
using magic, transfers them down the receiver and into
your ear. You can wear one or two depending on your
hearing loss, and you can turn your hearing aids on or
off using an Interact action.
Prosthesis: A prosthesis replaces a missing or
damaged body part. Typical prostheses include artificial
feet, eyes, hands, and limbs, though a basic prosthesis
can be designed as a replacement for any body part.
Advancements in the prosthetic field mean that even the
most basic of prostheses can provide the full range of
functionality for a missing body part.
A prosthesis has a number of belts or cuffs that keep
it attached to your body. You can attach or remove a
prosthesis as an Interact action.
Wheelchair: A common wheelchair is ideal for
everyday use but isn’t designed for strenuous activity.

These wheelchairs are most common among non-
adventurers. Wheelchairs come in a variety of sizes to

suit every person regardless of height or body type.
A traveler’s chair is tailored for frequent adventures
and travels. The design is sleek and fashionable to
provide excellent comfort and support. A traveler’s chair
has small mechanisms, either made from interlocking
wood pieces, clockwork, or other devices, that allow
the chair to traverse up or down stairs without any
additional difficulty (moving up stairs is still difficult
terrain, just like for other characters), and move
through other common adventuring terrain without any
additional difficulty, such as ladders and uneven ground.
Chair storage can be purchased and applied to
any wheelchair. This reduces the amount of Bulk the
items weigh when stored within the chair, much like
a backpack. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your
chair don’t count against your Bulk limit. If you use both
chair storage and a backpack at the same time, only 2
Bulk total isn’t counted against your limit, much like
if you used multiple backpacks or similar items at the
same time.
WHEELCHAIR RULES
Each wheelchair operates in the following ways.
Adjustable Seat Belts: These belts strap around your
waist, knees, and shins to keep you in the chair if it’s
thrown, knocked, or handled roughly. You can open and
release your belts with an Interact action.
Bulk Limit: A wheelchair is strong enough to support
you and any amount of Bulk you could typically hold or
carry. Your total carried Bulk includes all the items you are
wearing, carrying, and stowing on your wheelchair. You
take the usual effects when there’s too much Bulk on you
and your wheelchair: if you’re carrying an amount of Bulk
equal to 5 + your Strength modifier, you’re encumbered,
and you and your wheelchair can’t hold or carry more
than 10 + your Strength modifier. The wheelchair’s own
Bulk doesn’t count against your Bulk limit while riding
in the wheelchair; it’s listed in case you need to carry the
wheelchair separately.
Frame: A wheelchair is typically made from common
materials like wood, but they can also be made from steel,
other metals, or even rarer materials like dawnsilver. The
wheelchairs presented here are made from durable wood.
Magic: The wheelchair is considered an extension of
yourself. Spells or abilities that change your bodily form
also apply to the chair, and it transforms with you so
long as you’re using it. You can choose what appearance
this has.
Movement: While using a wheelchair, you Stride at
your normal Speed (listed in your ancestry, with any
additional bonuses, penalties, and adjustments applied).
You propel a wheelchair by using the hand rims. You can
propel the wheelchair even while holding something in
your hands, but not if you’re restrained or otherwise
unable to move your hands freely. You’re still affected by
difficult terrain and other terrain features. Any effect that
would immobilize you, give a penalty to your Speeds, or
similar by entangling or hindering your legs applies to
the chair as well. You can use all of your actions while in
a wheelchair.
Quick-Righting: If the chair is tipped or you’re knocked
prone while in the chair, you can right yourself using the
Stand action, though in this case you are righting the
wheelchair instead. An ally can use an Interact action
to help right you, allowing you to Stand as a free action
triggered by their Interact action.
Formulas
Formulas are formalized instructions for making items.
Their primary purpose is to reduce the time it takes you
to start the Craft activity, which is helpful for items
you’ll make frequently. You can usually read a formula
as long as you can read the language it’s written in, even
if you lack the skill to Craft the item. Often, alchemists
and crafting guilds use obscure languages or create codes

to protect their formulas. If you obtain a formula for an
uncommon or rarer item, you have access to that item
so you can Craft it. These formulas can be significantly
more valuable—if you can find them at all!
For the Price listed on the table, you can buy a common
formula or pay an NPC to let you copy their formula. A
purchased formula is typically a schematic on rolled-up
parchment of light Bulk. You can copy a formula into
your formula book in 1 hour.
If you have a formula, you can Craft a copy of it
using the Crafting skill. You can also Craft a formula by
reverse-engineering it from an item you possess. Use the
formula’s Price and the item’s Craft DC. You must meet
any requirements to Craft the item, except you don’t
need to have access to the item or meet any special Craft
Requirements listed in the item’s stat block unless the
GM determines otherwise.

dangerous lands can be more expensive or impossible.
Spellcasting
Spellcasting services are uncommon. Having a spell cast
for you requires finding a spellcaster who knows and is
willing to cast it. It’s hard to find someone who can cast
higher-rank spells, and uncommon spells typically cost
at least 100% more, if you can find someone who knows
them at all. Spells that take a long time to cast (over 1
minute) usually cost 25% more. You must pay any cost
listed in the spell in addition to the Price on the table.

Cost of Living
Cost of living provides a total cost to covers room
and board, dues, taxes, and other fees. You typically
need to track and pay for your cost of living only
during downtime.

Animals
The Prices for animals are listed both for renting and for
purchasing them outright. You usually need to pay for
animal rentals up front, and if the vendor believes the
animal might be put in danger, they typically require a
deposit equal to the purchase Price.
Most animals panic in battle unless specifically
trained otherwise. When combat begins, they become
frightened 4 and fleeing as long as they’re frightened. If
you successfully Command your Animal using Nature
(page 242), you can keep it from fleeing, though this
doesn’t remove its frightened condition. If the animal
is attacked or damaged, it returns to frightened 4 and
fleeing, with the same exceptions.
Warhorses and warponies are combat trained. They
don’t become frightened or fleeing during encounters in
this way.
Statistics for the animals appear in Monster Core.

Barding
You can purchase special armor for animals, called
barding (shown on the Barding table). All animals have

a trained proficiency rank in light barding, and combat-
trained animals are trained in heavy barding. Barding

uses the same rules as armor except for the following.
The Price and Bulk of barding depend on the animal’s
size (use the statistics for Small barding for creatures
below Small size). Barding can’t be etched with magic
runes, though special magical barding might be available.
