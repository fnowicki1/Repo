CHAPTER 7:
SPELLS
Whether it comes in the form of mystic artifacts, mysterious creatures, or wizards weaving
strange spells, magic brings fantasy and wonder to Pathfinder. This chapter explains how
spells work and how spellcasters prepare and cast their spells.
With special gestures and utterances, a spellcaster
can call forth mystic energies, warp the mind, protect
themself against danger, or even create something from
nothing. Each class has its own method of learning,
preparing, and casting spells, and every individual spell
produces a specific effect, so learning new spells gives a
spellcaster an increasing array of options to accomplish
their goals.
Spell Slots
Characters of spellcasting classes can cast a number
of spells each day; the spells you can cast in a day are
referred to as spell slots. At 1st level, a character has only
a small number of 1st-rank spell slots per day, but as you
advance in level, you gain more spell slots of higher rank.
A spell’s rank indicates its overall power, from 1 to 10.
Prepared Spells
If you’re a prepared spellcaster—such as a cleric, druid,
witch, or wizard—you must spend time each day
preparing spells for that day. At the start of your daily
preparations, you select a number of spells of different
spell ranks, determined by your character level and class.
Your spells remain prepared until you cast them or until
you prepare spells again.
Each prepared spell is expended after a single casting,
so if you want to cast a particular spell more than once
in a day, you need to prepare that spell multiple times.
The exception to this rule is for spells with the cantrip
trait; once you prepare a cantrip, you can cast it as many
times as you want until the next time you prepare spells.
See page 298 for more information on cantrips.
You might gain an ability that allows you to swap
prepared spells or perform other aspects of preparing
spells at different times throughout the day, but only
your daily preparation counts for the purpose of effects
that last until the next time you prepare spells.
Spontaneous Spells
If you’re a spontaneous spellcaster—such as a bard—you
choose which spell from your spell repertoire that you’re
using a spell slot for at the moment you decide to cast it. This
provides you with more freedom in your spellcasting, but
you have fewer spells in your spell repertoire, as determined
by your character level and class. When you make your
daily preparations, all your spell slots are refreshed, but you
don’t get to change the spells in your repertoire.
Heightened Spells
Both prepared and spontaneous spellcasters can cast
a spell at a higher spell rank than that listed for the
spell. This is called heightening the spell. A prepared
spellcaster can heighten a spell by preparing it in a
higher-rank slot than its normal spell rank, while a
spontaneous spellcaster can heighten a spell by casting
it using a higher-rank spell slot, so long as they know
the spell at that rank (see Heightened Spontaneous
Spells below). When you heighten your spell, the spell’s
rank increases to match the higher rank of the spell slot
you’ve prepared it in or used to cast it. This is useful for
any spell, because some effects, such as counteracting,
depend on the spell’s rank.
In addition, many spells have additional specific
benefits when they are heightened, such as increased
damage. These extra benefits are described at the end
of the spell’s stat block. Some heightened entries specify
one or more ranks at which the spell must be prepared
or cast to gain these extra advantages. Each of these
heightened entries states specifically which aspects of
the spell change at the given rank. Read the heightened
entry only for the spell rank you’re using or preparing;
if its benefits are meant to include any of the effects of
a lower-rank heightened entry, those benefits will be
included in the entry.
Other heightened entries give a number after a plus
sign, indicating that heightening grants extra advantages
over multiple ranks. The listed effect applies for every
increment of ranks by which the spell is heightened
above its lowest spell rank, and the benefit is cumulative.
For example, fireball says “Heightened (+1) The damage
increases by 2d6.” Because fireball deals 6d6 fire damage
at 3rd rank, a 4th-rank fireball would deal 8d6 fire
damage, a 5th-rank spell would deal 10d6 fire damage,
and so on.
Heightened Spontaneous Spells
If you’re a spontaneous spellcaster, you must know
a spell at the specific rank that you want to cast it in
order to heighten it. You can add a spell to your spell
repertoire at more than a single rank so that you have
more options when casting it. For example, if you added
fireball to your repertoire as a 3rd-rank spell and again
as a 5th-rank spell, you could cast it as a 3rd-rank or
a 5th-rank spell; however, you couldn’t cast it as a
4th-rank spell.
Many spontaneous spellcasting classes provide abilities
like the signature spells class feature, which allows you
to cast a limited number of spells as heightened versions
even if you know the spell at only a single rank.
As a spontaneous caster, you can also choose to cast
a lower-rank spell using a higher-rank spell slot without
heightening it or knowing it at a higher rank. This casts
the spell at the rank you know the spell, not the rank of
the higher slot. The spell doesn’t have any heightened
effects, so it’s usually not a very efficient use of your magic
outside of highly specific circumstances. For instance, if
your party was having trouble with an invisible enemy,
and you had revealing light in your repertoire but had
already spent all of your 2nd-rank spell slots, it might be
worth it to use a 3rd-rank spell slot to cast the spell, even
though it’d have no heightened benefit.
Cantrips
A cantrip is a special type of spell that’s weaker than
other spells but can be used with greater freedom
and flexibility. The title of a cantrip’s stat block says
“Cantrip” instead of “Spell”, and the spell has the
cantrip trait. Casting a cantrip doesn’t use up your spell
slots; you can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times
per day. If you’re a prepared caster, you can prepare a
specific number of cantrips each day. You can’t prepare
a cantrip in a spell slot.
A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half
your level, rounded up. For a typical spellcaster, this means
its rank is equal to the highest rank of spell slot you have.
Focus Spells
Focus spells are a special type of spell attained directly from
a branch of study, from a deity, or from another specific
source. You can learn focus spells only through special class
features or feats, rather than choosing them from a spell
list. Furthermore, you cast focus spells using a special pool
of Focus Points—you can’t prepare a focus spell in a spell
slot or use your spell slots to cast focus spells; similarly,
you can’t spend your Focus Points to cast spells that aren’t
focus spells. Even some classes that don’t normally grant
spellcasting can grant focus spells, such as the ranger. The
title of a focus spell’s stat block says “Focus” instead of
“Spell”, and the spell has the focus trait.
Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your
level rounded up, just like cantrips are. You can’t cast a
focus spell if its minimum rank is greater than half your
level rounded up, even if you somehow gain access to it.
Casting any of your focus spells costs you 1 Focus
Point. You automatically gain a focus pool the first time
you gain an ability that gives you a focus spell. The
maximum number of points in your pool is equal to
the number of focus spells you know or 3, whichever is
lower. This counts only spells that require Focus Points
to cast. For example, a bard’s composition cantrips don’t
count toward the size of the pool.

You replenish all the Focus Points in your pool during
your daily preparations. You can also use the Refocus
activity to pray, study, meditate, or otherwise reattune
yourself to the source of your focus magic and regain 1
Focus Point. You can Refocus multiple times to regain
multiple points, up to your pool’s maximum.
REFOCUS
CONCENTRATE EXPLORATION
Requirements You have a focus pool.
You spend 10 minutes performing deeds to restore your magical
connection. This restores 1 Focus Point to your focus pool. The
deeds you need to perform are specified in the class or ability
that gives you your focus spells. These deeds can usually
overlap with other tasks that relate to the source of your focus
spells. For instance, a cleric with focus spells from a holy deity
can usually Refocus while tending the wounds of their allies.
Spellcasters with Focus Spells
If you are a spellcaster, your focus spells are the same
tradition of spell as the class that gave you the focus
spell. A bard’s are occult, a cleric’s are divine, a druid’s
are primal, a wizard’s are arcane, and a witch’s are
determined by their patron.
Non-Spellcasters with Focus Spells
If you get focus spells from a class or other source that
doesn’t grant spellcasting ability, the ability that gives
you focus spells also provides your proficiency for your
spell attack modifier and spell DC, as well as the magical
tradition of your focus spells. Though you can cast your
focus spells, you don’t qualify for feats and other rules
that require you to be a spellcaster or have a spellcasting
class feature—those require you to have spell slots.
Focus Points from Multiple Sources
It’s possible, especially through archetypes, to gain focus
spells from more than one source. If this happens, you
have just one focus pool, counting all your focus spells to
determine the points in your pool. You can spend any of
your Focus Points on any of your focus spells. Likewise,
when you Refocus, you get back a point as long as you
follow the guidelines of any abilities that granted you
focus spells. Having Focus Points from multiple sources
doesn’t change the tradition of your spells; if you had
both cleric domain spells and druid order spells, your
domain spells would remain divine and the order spells
primal. Similarly, you need to use the attribute modifier
determined by the source of the focus spell.
Innate Spells
Certain spells are natural to your character, typically
coming from your ancestry or a magic item. They’re
called innate spells. Innate spells don’t let you qualify for
abilities that require you to be a spellcaster—those require
you to have spell slots. The ability that gives you an innate
spell tells you how often you can cast it—usually once per
day—and its magical tradition. Innate spells are refreshed
during your daily preparations. Innate cantrips are cast at
will and automatically heightened as normal for cantrips
(page 298) unless otherwise specified.
When you gain an innate spell, you become trained
in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. At
12th level, these proficiencies increase to expert. Unless
noted otherwise, Charisma is your spellcasting attribute
modifier for innate spells.
If you have an innate spell, you can cast it even if it’s not
of a spell rank you can normally cast. This is especially
common for monsters.
You can’t use your spell slots to cast your innate spells,
but you might have an innate spell and also be able to
prepare or cast the same spell through your class. You also
can’t heighten innate spells, but some abilities that grant
innate spells might give you the spell at a higher rank than
its base rank or change the rank at which you cast the spell.
MAGICAL TRADITIONS

Spellcasters cast spells from one of four different spell lists, each representing a different magical tradition: arcane, divine,
occult, and primal.
Your class determines which tradition of magic your spells use. In some cases, such as when a cleric gains spells from
their deity or when a witch gets spells from their patron, you might be able to cast one or more select spells from a different
spell list than the list you normally cast from; for instance, clerics of Sarenrae gain the power to summon their goddess’s
flames with a fireball spell. In these cases, the spell uses your magic tradition, not the list the spell normally comes from.
When you cast a spell, add your tradition’s trait to the spell.
Some types of magic, such as that of most magic items, don’t belong to any single tradition. These have the magical trait
instead of a tradition trait.
Arcane
Arcane spellcasters use logic and rationality
to categorize the magic inherent in the
world around them. Because of its far-reaching approach,
the arcane tradition has the broadest spell list, though it’s
generally poor at affecting the spirit or the soul. Wizards
are a prototypical arcane spellcaster, poring over tomes
and grimoires.
Divine
The power of the divine is steeped in
faith, the unseen, and belief in a power
source from beyond the Universe. Clerics are an iconic
divine spellcaster, beseeching the gods to grant them
their magic.
Occult
The practitioners of occult traditions seek
to understand the unexplainable, categorize
the bizarre, and otherwise access the ephemeral in
a systematic way. Bards are a fundamental occult
spellcaster, collecting strange esoterica and using their
performances to influence the mind or elevate the soul.
Primal
An instinctual connection to and faith in the
world, the cycle of day and night, the turning of
the seasons, and the natural selection of predator and prey
drive the primal tradition. Druids are a great example of a
primal spellcaster, calling upon the magic of nature through
a deep connection to the plants and animals around them.
Casting Spells
The casting of a spell can range from a simple word of
magical might that creates a fleeting effect to a complex
process taking hours to cast and producing a long-term
impact. Casting a spell requires the caster to make gestures
and utter incantations, so being unable to speak prevents

spellcasting for most casters. If your character has a long-
term disability that prevents or complicates them from

speaking (as described in GM Core), work with the GM
to determine an analogous way they cast their spells, such
as tapping in code on their staff or whistling.
Spellcasting creates obvious sensory manifestations,
such as bright lights, crackling sounds, and sharp smells
from the gathering magic. Nearly all spells manifest a
spell signature—a colorful, glowing ring of magical runes
that appears in midair, typically around your hands,
though what kind of spellcaster you are can affect this—
academic wizards typically have neat and ordered spell
signatures, while a druid’s might be more organic and a
cleric’s might be inspired by their deity. How spellcasting
looks can vary from one spellcasting tradition or class
to another, or even from person to person. You have a
great deal of freedom in flavoring your character’s magic
however you wish!
Spells can vary in how many actions they take, as
shown in the spell’s stat block. You cast cantrips, spells
from spell slots, and focus spells using the same process,
but must expend the spell when casting a spell from a
spell slot and must spend 1 Focus Point to cast a focus
spell. Some rules will refer to the Cast a Spell activity,
such as “if the next action you use is to Cast a Spell.”
Any spell qualifies as a Cast a Spell activity, and any
characteristics of the spell use those of the specific spell
you’re casting.
THE FOUR ESSENCES

Spells that affect certain physical or metaphysical forces tend to be grouped into particular magical areas. Scholars of magic
widely agree that all of existence is composed of some combination of four essences, though they disagree on the names
and particular qualities of each essence.
Matter
Also called body, material essence,
or physical essence, matter is the
fundamental building block that makes up all
physical things in the universe. The arcane and primal
traditions are especially attuned toward manipulating
and shaping matter.
Spirit
Also called soul, ethereal essence, or
spiritual essence, spirit is an otherworldly
building block that makes up a being’s immaterial and
immortal self. The spirit travels through the Ethereal
Plane and into the Great Beyond after the death of the
physical body. The spirit is most easily affected by divine
and occult spells.
Mind
Also called thought, mental, or astral essence,
mind is what allows thinking creatures to have
rational thoughts, ideas, plans, logic, and memories. Mind
touches even non-sapient creatures like animals, though
in a more limited capacity. Arcane and occult casters
usually excel at mind spells.
Life
Also called heart, faith, instinct, or vital
essence, life represents the animating universal
force within all things. Whereas matter provides the base
materials for a body, life keeps it alive and well. This
essence is responsible for unconscious responses and
belief, such as ancestral instincts and divine guidance.
The divine and primal traditions hold power over life.
Costs and Loci
Some spells require you to pay a cost or provide a locus.
If the spell lists a cost, you must have the listed money,
valuable materials, or other resources to cast the spell
(such as gems or magical reagents), and they’re expended
during the casting.
A locus is an object that funnels or directs the magical
energy of the spell but is not consumed in its casting.
As part of Casting the Spell, you retrieve the locus (if
necessary, and if you have a free hand), and you can
put it away again if you so choose. Loci tend to be
expensive, and you need to acquire them in advance to
cast the spell, but they aren’t expended like costs are.
Unless noted otherwise, a locus has negligible Bulk.
Long Casting Times
Some spells take minutes or hours to cast. You can’t use
other actions or reactions while casting such a spell,
though at the GM’s discretion, you might be able to
speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take
a long time, these spells have the exploration trait, and
you can’t cast them in an encounter. If combat breaks
out while you’re casting one, your spell is disrupted (see
Disrupted and Lost Spells below).
Disrupted and Lost Spells
Some abilities and spells can disrupt a spell, causing it
to have no effect and be lost. When you lose a spell,
you’ve already expended the spell slot and spent the
spell’s costs and actions. If a spell is disrupted during a
Sustain action, the spell immediately ends. The full rules
for disrupting actions appear on page 415.

Ranges, Areas, and
Targets
Spells with a range can affect targets, create areas, or
make things appear only within that range. Most spell
ranges are measured in feet, though some can stretch over
miles, reach anywhere on the planet, or go even farther!
Touch Range
A spell with a touch range requires you to physically touch
the target. You use your unarmed reach to determine
whether you can touch the creature. You can usually
touch them automatically, though the spell might specify
that they can attempt a saving throw or that you must
attempt a spell attack roll. If an ability increases the range
of a touch spell, start at 0 feet and increase from there.
Areas
Sometimes a spell has an area, which can be a burst, cone,
emanation, or line (pages 428–429). If the spell originates
from your position, the spell has only an area; if you can
cause the spell’s area to appear farther away from you,
the spell has both a range and an area.
Targets
Some spells allow you to target a creature, an object, or
something more specific. The target must be within the
spell’s range, and you must be able to see it (or otherwise
perceive it with a precise sense) to target it. At the GM’s
discretion, you can attempt to target a creature you can’t
see, as described in Detecting Creatures on page 434. If you
fail to target a particular creature, this doesn’t change how
the spell affects any other targets the spell has.
If you choose a target that isn’t valid, such as if you
thought a vampire was a living creature and targeted it
with a spell that can target only living creatures, your
spell fails to target that creature. If a creature starts out
as a valid target but ceases to be one during a spell’s
duration, the spell typically ends, but the GM might
decide otherwise in certain situations. Some spells restrict
you to willing targets. A player can declare their character
a willing or unwilling target at any time, regardless of
turn order or their character’s condition (such as when a
character is paralyzed, unconscious, or even dead).
Spells that affect multiple creatures in an area can
have both an Area entry and a Targets entry. A spell
that has an area but no targets listed usually affects all
creatures in the area indiscriminately.
OTHER SPELL TRAITS
Below is a glossary of a few traits you might see with important rules.
Darkness and Light

Non-magical light always shines in non-magical darkness
and always fails to shine in magical darkness. Magical light
always shines in non-magical darkness but shines in magical
darkness only if the light spell has a higher rank than that
of the darkness effect. Spells with the darkness trait or the
light trait can always counteract one another, but bringing
light and darkness into contact doesn’t automatically do
so. You must usually cast a light spell on a darkness effect
directly to counteract it (and vice versa), but some spells
automatically attempt to counteract opposing effects.

Minion

Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature.
Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when
you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal
companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that’s a
spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you
Sustain the effect (page 419); if not otherwise specified, you
issue a verbal command as a single action with the auditory
and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use
no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious
harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute,
mindless minions usually don’t act, animals follow their
instincts, and sapient minions act how they please.
A minion has only 2 actions and 0 reactions per turn,
though certain conditions (such as slowed or quickened)
or abilities might give them a reaction that they can use.
Alterations to a minion’s actions occur when they gain their
actions for the round. A minion can’t control other creatures.

Summoned

A creature called by a spell or effect gains the summoned trait.
A summoned creature can’t summon other creatures, create
things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the
minion trait. If it tries to cast a spell of equal or higher rank
than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning
magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon spell to
end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard
abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your
enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with
it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the
degree to which it follows your commands.
Immediately when you finish casting, the summoned
creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn or other
creature generated from a summoned creature returns to
its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn)
once the summoned creature is gone. If it’s unclear what
this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures
can be banished by various spells and effects. They are
automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the
spell that called them ends.
Morph

Spells that slightly alter a creature’s form have the morph trait.
Any Strikes specifically granted by a magical morph effect also
gain the magical trait. You can be affected by multiple morph
spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more
than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract
the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects,
described below). Your morph effects might also end if you are
polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides
your morph effect. For instance, a morph that gave you wings
would be dismissed if you polymorphed into a form that had
wings of its own (though if your new form lacked wings, you’d
keep the wings from your morph). The GM determines which
morph effects can be used together and which can’t.
Polymorph

These effects completely transform the target into a new form.
A target can’t be under the effect of more than one polymorph
at a time. If it comes under the effect of another, the second
effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes
effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any
Strikes granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless
otherwise stated, polymorph spells don’t allow the target to
take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but
rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.
If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the
special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance
bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise
noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells,
speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require
hands. (If there’s doubt about whether you can use an action,
the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant
abilities of your gear still function, but you can’t activate any
items. If a polymorph effect causes you to increase in size,
you must have space to expand into or the effect is disrupted.

Illusions

Magic with the illusion trait creates false sensory stimuli.
Sometimes illusions allow creatures a chance to disbelieve
the spell, which lets the creature ignore the spell if it
succeeds at doing so. This usually happens when a creature
Seeks, Interacts, or otherwise spends actions to engage with
the illusion, comparing the result of its Perception check
(or another check or save the GM chooses) to the caster’s
spell DC. Mental illusions typically provide rules in the spell’s
description for disbelieving the effect (usually via a Will save).
If a creature engages with an illusion in a way that would
prove it’s not what it seems, the creature might know that an
illusion is present, but it still can’t ignore the illusion without
successfully disbelieving it. Disbelieving a visual illusion makes
it and those things it blocks seem hazy and indistinct, which
might block vision enough to leave the other side concealed.
SUBTLE SPELLS

A spell with the subtle trait can be cast without
incantations and doesn’t have obvious manifestations.
Most of these spells enhance your subterfuge or stealth,
such as invisibility. Some abilities, like the Conceal Spell
feat (page 201), allow you to make spells subtle even if
they wouldn’t normally be.
SPELLSHAPE

Many spellcasters can gain access to spellshape actions,
typically by selecting spellshape feats. Spellshape actions
tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a
spellshape action directly before casting the spell you
want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions
and reactions) other than casting a spell directly after, you
waste the benefits of the spellshape action. The benefit is
also lost if your turn ends before you cast the spell. Any
additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of
the spell’s effect, not of the spellshape action itself.
Line of Effect
You usually need an unobstructed path to the target of a
spell, the origin point of an area, or the place where you
create something with a spell. More information on line
of effect can be found on page 426.
Durations
The duration of a spell is how long the spell effect lasts.
Spells that last for more than an instant have a Duration
entry. A spell might last until the start or end of a turn,
for some number of rounds, for minutes, or even longer.
If a spell’s duration is given in rounds, the number of
rounds remaining decreases by 1 at the start of each of the
spellcaster’s turns, ending when the duration reaches 0.
Some spells have effects that remain even after the spell’s
magic is gone. Any ongoing effect that isn’t part of the
spell’s duration entry isn’t magical. For instance, a spell
that creates a brief, loud sound might deafen someone

for a time, even permanently. This deafness couldn’t be
counteracted because it is not itself magical (though it
might be cured by other magic, such as sound body).
If a spell’s caster dies or is incapacitated during the
spell’s duration, the spell remains in effect until its
duration ends, using the caster’s initiative order.
Sustaining Spells
If the spell’s duration is “sustained,” it lasts until the end
of your next turn unless you use the Sustain action (page
419) on that turn to extend the duration of that spell.
Long Durations
If a spell’s duration says it lasts until your next daily
preparations, on the next day you can refrain from
preparing a new spell in that spell’s slot. (If you are a
spontaneous caster, you can instead expend a spell
slot during your preparations.) Doing so extends the
spell’s duration until your next daily preparations. This
effectively Sustains the spell over a long period of time.
If you prepare a new spell in the slot (or don’t expend
a spell slot), the spell ends. You can’t do this if the spell
didn’t come from one of your spell slots. If you are dead
or otherwise incapacitated at the 24-hour mark after the
time you Cast the Spell or the last time you extended
its duration, the spell ends. Spells with an unlimited
duration last until counteracted or Dismissed. You don’t
need to keep a spell slot open for these spells.
Dismissing
Some spells can be dismissed, ending the duration early.
This requires the caster or target to use the Dismiss
action (page 419).
Defenses
If a spell allows the target to attempt a saving throw
or use their AC to defend against it, the type of defense
is listed in the stat block. Any details on the particular
results and timing of the save appear in the text unless
the entry specifies a basic saving throw, which follows
a standard rule. If a spell allows a defense only under
certain circumstances or at a certain time, the Defenses
entry is omitted, since the text needs to explain it in more
detail. Whenever a spell allows a saving throw, it uses the
caster’s spell DC, and one that allows AC as a defense
typically requires a spell attack. More information on
how to calculate your spell DC and spell attack modifier
appears on page 403.
Basic Saving Throws
If a spell’s Defenses entry specifies a “basic” saving throw,
the spell’s potential effects all relate to the damage listed
in the spell’s description. The target takes no damage on
a critical success, half damage on a success, full damage
on a failure, or double damage on a critical failure. The
rules for basic saving throws are found on page 404.
Spell Attacks
Some spells require you to succeed at a spell attack roll
to affect the target. This is usually because they require
you to precisely aim a ray or otherwise make an accurate
attack. A spell attack roll is compared to the target’s AC.
Spell attack rolls benefit from any bonuses or penalties
to attack rolls, including your multiple attack penalty,
but not any special benefits or penalties that apply only
to weapon or unarmed attacks. Spell attacks don’t deal
any damage beyond what’s listed in the spell description.
In rare cases, a spell might have you make some other
type of attack, such as a weapon Strike. Such attacks use
the normal rules and attack bonus for that type of attack.
Identifying Spells
Sometimes you need to identify a spell, especially if its
effects aren’t obvious right away. If you notice a spell
being cast, and you have that spell in your repertoire
or prepared it that day (even if you already cast it), you
automatically know what the spell is, including the rank
to which it is heightened.
If you want to identify a spell but don’t have it
prepared or in your repertoire, you must spend an
action on your turn attempting to identify it using
Recall Knowledge. You typically notice a spell being
cast due to its sensory spell manifestations (page
299). Identifying long-lasting spells that are already in
place requires using Identify Magic instead of Recall
Knowledge because you don’t have the advantage of
watching the spell being cast.
Counteracting
Some spells, such as dispel magic, can be used to eliminate
the effects of other spells. At least one creature, object,
or manifestation of the spell you are trying to counteract
must be within range of the spell that you are using.
You attempt a counteract check (page 431) using your
Charisma (or other spellcasting attribute modifier) and
your proficiency bonus for spell attack rolls.
Hostile Actions
Sometimes spells prevent a target from using hostile
actions, or the spell ends if a creature uses any hostile
actions. A hostile action is one that can harm or damage
another creature, whether directly or indirectly, but not
one that a creature is unaware could cause harm. For
instance, casting fireball into a crowd would be a hostile
action, but opening a door and accidentally freeing a
horrible monster wouldn’t be. The GM is the final
arbitrator of what is a hostile action.
Setting Triggers
If a spell is meant to respond only to certain events
or under certain conditions, it might require you to
set a trigger. This is a simple sensory cue that causes
the spell to activate. The spell activates as a reaction

when the spell’s sensor observes something that fits its
trigger. Depending on the spell, the trigger might be the
presence of a type of creature, such as “red-bearded
dwarven men,” or it could be an observed action, such
as “whenever someone enters the spell’s area.”
Disguises and illusions fool the spell as long as they
appear to match its parameters. For a spell to detect
something visually, the spell’s origin point must have line
of sight. Darkness doesn’t prevent this, but invisibility
does, as does a successful Stealth check to Hide (against
the spell’s DC). For auditory detection, line of sight isn’t
necessary, though the sound must be audible at the spell’s
origin point. A Stealth check to Sneak can fool the sensor.
Walls
Spells that create walls list the depth, length, and height
of the wall, also specifying how it can be positioned.
Some walls can be shaped; you can manipulate the
wall into a form other than a straight line, choosing its
contiguous path square by square. The path of a shaped
wall can’t enter the same space more than once, but it
can double back so one section is adjacent to another
section of the wall.
Reading Spells
Each spell uses the following format. Entries appear only
when applicable, so not all spells will have every entry
described here. The spell’s name line also lists the type of
spell if it’s a cantrip or focus spell, as well as the rank.
SPELL NAME [one-action] SPELL (RANK)
TRAITS
Tradition This entry lists the magical traditions the spell
belongs to. Some feats or other abilities might add a spell to
your spell list even if you don’t follow the listed traditions.
Cast Spells that take longer than a single turn to cast include
this entry to list the time required, such as “1 minute.” If
the spell has a cost, locus, requirements, or a trigger, that
information is also listed in this section.
Range, Area, and Targets This entry lists the range of the spell,
the area it affects, and the targets it can affect, if any. If
none of these entries are present, the spell affects only
the caster.
Defense and Duration If a spell allows the target to attempt a
saving throw or use their AC to defend against it, the type of
defense appears here (see page 302 for details). A Duration
entry appears if the spell has one. A spell that doesn’t list a
duration takes place instantaneously, and anything created
by it persists after the spell.
A horizontal line follows defense and duration, and the effects
of the spell are described after this line. This section might also
detail the possible results of a saving throw: critical success,
success, failure, and critical failure.
Heightened (rank) If the spell has special effects when
heightened (page 297), those effects appear at the end of
the stat block.
SPELL LISTS
These lists include the spells for each tradition, including cantrips. (Focus spells appear
on pages 370–388.) A superscript “H” indicates a spell has extra effects when heightened,
and a spell whose rarity is greater than common has a superscript with the first letter of
that rarity (for example, “U” for uncommon).

AERIAL FORM [two-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions arcane, primal
Duration 1 minute
You harness your mastery of the sky to reshape your body
into a Medium flying animal battle form. When you Cast this
Spell, choose a listed battle form. You can decide the specific
type of animal (such as an owl or eagle for bird), but this has
no effect on the form’s Size or statistics. While in this form,
you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss the spell.
You gain specific abilities based on the animal you choose:
• AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty
and Speed reduction.
• 5 temporary Hit Points.
• Low-light vision.
• One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle
form you choose, which are the only attacks you can
Strike with. You’re trained with them. Your attack modifier
is +16, and your damage bonus is +5. These attacks are
Dexterity based (for the purpose of the clumsy condition,
for example). If your attack modifier for Dexterity-based
unarmed attacks is higher, you can use it instead.
• Acrobatics modifier of +16, unless your own is higher.
You also gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:
• Bat Speed 20 feet, fly 30 feet; precise echolocation 40
feet; Melee [one-action] fangs, Damage 2d8 piercing; Melee [one-action]
wing (agile), Damage 2d6 bludgeoning.

Duration 8 hours
You ward an area to alert you when creatures enter without
your permission. When you cast alarm, select a password.
Whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature enters the
spell’s area without speaking the password, alarm sends your
choice of a mental alert (in which case the spell gains the
mental trait) or an audible alarm with the sound and volume
of a hand bell (in which case the spell gains the auditory trait).
Either option automatically awakens you, and the bell allows
each creature in the area to attempt a DC 15 Perception check
to wake up. A creature aware of the alarm must succeed at a
Stealth check against the spell’s DC or trigger the spell when
moving into the area.
Heightened (3rd) You can specify a trigger for which types
of creatures sound the alarm spell, as described in Setting
Triggers on page 303.

You call upon primal energy to transform yourself into a
Medium animal battle form. When you Cast this Spell, choose

ANIMAL MESSENGER SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions primal
Cast 1 minute
Range 120 feet
Duration see text

You offer food, and an ordinary Tiny animal within range
approaches to eat it. You imprint the image, direction, and
distance of an obvious place or landmark well known to you
within the animal. You can also attach a small object or note up to
light Bulk to it. The animal does its best to reach the destination; if
it makes it there, it waits nearby and allows nonhostile creatures
to approach and remove the attached object. The spell ends after
the message is delivered or after 24 hours, whichever comes first.
If there are no Tiny wild animals in range, the spell is lost.
ANT HAUL [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 8 hours
You reinforce the target’s musculoskeletal system to bear more
weight. The target can carry 3 more Bulk than normal before
becoming encumbered and up to a maximum of 6 more Bulk.
AQUEOUS ORB [two-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE WATER
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 60 feet
Defense Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
A sphere of water 10 feet in diameter forms in an unoccupied
space in range, either on the ground or on the surface of a liquid.
When you Cast this Spell and each time you Sustain it, you can
roll the orb, moving it up to 10 feet along the ground or the
surface of a liquid. The orb can move through the spaces of any
creatures or obstacles that wouldn’t stop the flow of water. It
extinguishes non-magical fires it moves through of its size or
smaller, and it attempts to counteract any magical fires it moves
through. If it fails to counteract a given fire, it can’t counteract
that fire for the duration of the spell.
The orb can engulf Large or smaller creatures it moves
through, and it can contain as many creatures as fit in its
space. The orb can try to engulf the same creature only once
per turn, even if you roll it onto a creature’s space more than
once. Any Large or smaller creature whose space the orb tries
to move through can attempt a Reflex save.
Success The creature can either let the orb pass (remaining in
its space or moving out of the orb’s path into a space of the
creature’s choice) or allow itself to be pushed in front of the
orb to the end of the orb’s movement.
Failure The creature is engulfed in the orb. It moves along with
the orb and must hold its breath or begin suffocating (unless
it can breathe in water). An engulfed Medium or smaller
creature and anyone trying to affect that creature follow
the normal rules for aquatic battles (page 437). An engulfed
Large creature is usually big enough that parts of it stick out
from the water, and it can reach out of the water.
The creature can get free either by Swimming with a
successful DC 10 Athletics check or by Escaping against
your spell DC. A freed creature exits the orb’s space and can
immediately breathe.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature can’t Swim to get free.
ARCTIC RIFT [two-actions] SPELL 8
COLD CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Area 120-foot line
Defense Fortitude
A jagged crack opens in the air, dealing 12d8 cold damage
as it draws away warmth. Each creature along the rift must
attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is slowed 1 until the
start of your next turn.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage, is
immobilized by a layer of ice, and is slowed 1 as long as
its immobilized. The ice is an object with 60 Hit Points,
Hardness 5, immunity to cold damage, and vulnerability 10
to fire. It has object immunities (page 269) and is destroyed
if the target Escapes.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d8 and the ice’s Hit
Points increase by 5.
AUGURY SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE PREDICTION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast 10 minutes
You gain a vague glimpse of the future. During the casting of
this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action.
The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future
and reveal the GM’s best guess among the following outcomes:
good, bad, mixed (the results will be a mix of good and bad), and
nothing (there won’t be particularly good or bad results).
The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result
is always “nothing.” This makes it impossible to tell whether a
“nothing” result is accurate. If anyone asks about the same topic
as the first casting of augury during an additional casting, the GM
uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances
change, though, it’s possible to get a different result.

Traditions divine
Range 120 feet; Area up to a 60-foot burst
Defense Reflex; Duration 1 minute
Manifestations of divine force appear in the hundreds, swirling
in a massive, protective sphere. These typically look like spiky

of the caster. The sphere is hollow, with the manifestations
forming a shell 2 inches deep on the outer edge. You can choose
to make the burst smaller, in 5-foot increments, when you cast it.
The shell provides cover and can intersect solid terrain
without affecting it. The shell deals 7d8 force damage to each
creature who intersects with the shell when the sphere’s
created, or who attempts to move through the shell. The
creature also takes the damage at the end of its turn, but only
if it didn’t already take damage from the shell that turn. The
effects are determined by a creature’s Reflex save.

nonviolent state; each creature must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success Calming urges impose a –1 status penalty to the

AUDITORY CONCENTRATE CURSE EMOTION FEAR MANIPULATE MENTAL

additional creatures
Defense basic Reflex
You discharge a powerful bolt of lightning at the target, dealing
8d12 electricity damage. The target must attempt a basic
Reflex save. The electricity then arcs to another creature within
30 feet of the first target, jumps to another creature within
30 feet of that target, and so on. You can end the chain at any
point. You can’t target the same creature more than once, and
you must have line of effect to all targets. Roll the damage
only once and apply it to each target (halving or doubling as
appropriate for its saving throw outcome). The chain ends if
any one of the targets critically succeeds at its save.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d12.
CHARM [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE EMOTION INCAPACITATION MANIPULATE MENTAL SUBTLE

To the target, your words are honey and your visage seems
bathed in a dreamy haze. It must attempt a Will save, with a +4
circumstance bonus if you or your allies recently threatened it
or used hostile actions against it.
You can Dismiss the spell. If you use hostile actions against
the target, the spell ends. When the spell ends, the target
doesn’t necessarily realize it was charmed unless its friendship
with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with
its expectations, meaning you could potentially convince the
target to continue being your friend via mundane means.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and aware you tried
to charm it.
Success The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was
something harmless instead of charm, unless it identifies
the spell (see Identifying Spells on page 303).

If the ray passes through an area of magical light or targets a

stage one, reduce the stage by one. This reduction can be

can’t counteract or suppress conditions that are part of curses,
diseases, or a natural state of the target.

the target to approach you, run away (as if it had the fleeing

Cast 10 minutes
Duration until your next daily preparations
You prepare a spell that will trigger later. While casting
contingency, you also cast another spell of 4th rank or lower with
a casting time of no more than 3 actions. This companion spell

must be one that can affect you. You must make any decisions for
the spell when you cast contingency, such as choosing a damage
type for resist energy. During the casting, choose a trigger under
which the spell will be cast, using the same restrictions as for
the trigger of a Ready action. Once contingency is cast, you can
cause the companion spell to come into effect as a reaction with
that trigger. It affects only you, even if it would affect more
creatures. If you define complicated conditions, as determined
by the GM, the trigger might fail. If you cast contingency again,
the newer casting supersedes the older.
Heightened (8th) You can choose a spell of 5th rank or lower.
Heightened (9th) You can choose a spell of 6th rank or lower.
Heightened (10th) You can choose a spell of 7th rank or lower.

has one wooden door. It doesn’t include its own lock, but it has
a fastener to which a lock can be applied.
The interior contains three cots, one chamber pot, and a small
fireplace holding a magical fire. The interior is lit with a small
magical light that you can light or extinguish at will using a

allows creatures inside it to withstand most hostile weather
conditions, but incredible heat or cold, powerful storms, and
winds of hurricane force or greater destroy the hut. Other
creatures can freely enter and exit the hut without damaging it,
but if you exit the hut, the spell ends. You can Dismiss the spell.

CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast 1 minute
Range 0 feet
Duration 1 hour
You conjure a temporary object from magical energy. It must
consist of earthen or plant-derived matter (such as wood,
paper, brick, or stone) and be 5 cubic feet or smaller. It can’t
rely on intricate artistry or complex moving parts, never fulfills
a cost or the like, and can’t be made of precious materials or
materials with a rarity of uncommon or higher. It is obviously
temporarily conjured, and thus can’t be sold or passed off as a
genuine item. The spell gains the appropriate trait for the item
created, typically earth, plant, or wood.
Heightened (5th) The item is metal and can include common
minerals, like feldspar or quartz. The spell gains the metal
trait if used to create a metal object.
CRISIS OF FAITH [two-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions divine
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will
You assault the target’s faith, riddling the creature with
doubt and mental turmoil that deal 6d6 mental damage, or
6d8 mental damage if it can cast divine spells. The effects are
determined by its Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes half damage.
Failure The target takes full damage; if the target can cast
divine spells, it’s stupefied 1 for 1 round.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage, is stupefied 1
for 1 round, and can’t cast divine spells for 1 round.
To many deities, casting this spell on a follower of your own
deity without significant cause is anathema.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6 (or by 2d8 if the
target is a divine spellcaster).
CURSED METAMORPHOSIS [two-actions] SPELL 6
CONCENTRATE CURSE INCAPACITATION MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions arcane, occult, primal

Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Fortitude; Duration varies
You transform the target creature into a harmless animal
appropriate to the area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target’s body gains minor features of the harmless
animal. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing
it to be sickened 1. When it recovers from the sickened
condition, its features revert to normal.
Failure The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps its mind. If
it spends all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original
form, it can attempt a Will save to end the effect immediately.
Critical Failure The target is transformed into the chosen
harmless animal, body and mind, for an unlimited duration.
DARKNESS [three-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE DARKNESS MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Duration 1 minute
You create a shroud of darkness that prevents light from
penetrating or emanating within the area. Light does not enter
the area and any non-magical light sources, such as a torch or
lantern, do not emanate any light while inside the area, even
if their light radius would extend beyond the darkness. This
also suppresses magical light of your darkness spell’s rank or
lower. Light can’t pass through, so creatures in the area can’t see
outside. From outside, it appears as a globe of pure darkness.
Heightened (4th) Even creatures with darkvision (but not
greater darkvision) can barely see through the darkness.
They treat targets seen through the darkness as concealed.
DARKVISION [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Duration 1 hour
You grant yourself supernatural sight in areas of darkness. You
gain darkvision.
Heightened (3rd) The spell’s range is touch and it targets 1
willing creature.
Heightened (5th) The spell’s range is touch and it targets 1 willing
creature. The duration is until your next daily preparations.
DAZE [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL NONLETHAL
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration 1 round
You push into the target’s mind and daze it with a mental jolt.
The jolt deals 1d6 mental damage, with a basic Will save. If the
target critically fails the save, it is also stunned 1.
Heightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d6.
DEAFNESS [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Fortitude
The target loses its hearing. It must attempt a Fortitude save,
and it is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is deafened for 1 round.
Failure The target is deafened for 10 minutes.
Critical Failure The target is deafened permanently.
DESICCATE [two-actions] SPELL 8
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE VOID
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 500 feet; Targets any number of living creatures
Defense basic Fortitude
You pull the moisture from the targets’ bodies, dealing
10d10 void damage. Creatures made of water (such as water
elementals) and plant creatures use the outcome for one
degree of success worse than the result of their saving throw.
Creatures whose bodies contain no significant moisture (such
as earth elementals) are immune to desiccate.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d10.
DETECT MAGIC [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP CONCENTRATE DETECTION MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Area 30-foot emanation

You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic. You
receive no information beyond the presence or absence of magic.
You can choose to ignore magic you’re fully aware of, such as the
magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies.
You detect illusion magic only if that magic’s effect has a
lower rank than the rank of your detect magic spell. However,
items that have an illusion aura but aren’t deceptive in
appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are
detected normally.
Heightened (3rd) You learn the rank or level of the most powerful
magical effect the spell detects, as determined by the GM.
Heightened (4th) As 3rd rank, but you also pinpoint the source
of the highest-rank magic. Like for an imprecise sense, you
don’t learn the exact location, but can narrow down the source
to within a 5-foot cube (or the nearest if larger than that).
DETECT POISON [two-actions] SPELL 1
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE DETECTION MANIPULATE
Traditions divine, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 object or creature
You detect whether a creature is venomous or poisonous, or if
an object is poison or has been poisoned. You do not ascertain
whether the target is poisonous in multiple ways, nor do you
learn the type or types of poison. Certain substances, like lead
and alcohol, are poisons and so mask other poisons.
Heightened (2nd) You learn the number and types of poison.
DETECT SCRYING [two-actions] SPELL 4
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE DETECTION MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Area 30-foot emanation
Duration 1 hour
By reading trace auras, you detect the presence of scrying
effects in the area. If detect scrying is higher rank than a
scrying effect, you gain a glimpse of the scrying creature and
learn its approximate distance and direction.
Heightened (6th) The duration is until your next daily
preparations.
DETONATE MAGIC [two-actions] SPELL 9
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 magic item or spell effect
Defense basic Reflex (see text)
You cause the magic within the target to dissipate in a
destructive explosion. You attempt to counteract the target
(page 431). If the attempt succeeds, an explosion of magical
force deals 8d6 force damage with a basic Reflex save. If you
successfully counteract the magic of an item, it’s deactivated
for 1 week (or destroyed on a critical success) and the explosion
is a 5-foot emanation from the item. If you successfully
counteract a spell, the effect ends and the explosion affects
either all creatures in the spells’ area or the target of the spell
and all creatures in a 5-foot emanation around it.
DINOSAUR FORM [two-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions primal
Duration 1 minute
You channel the primal forces of nature to transform into a Large
animal battle form, specifically that of a powerful and terrifying
dinosaur. When you Cast this Spell, choose a listed battle form.
You can decide the specific type of animal, but this has no effect
on the form’s Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the
animal and dinosaur traits. You can Dismiss the spell.
You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of
which battle form you choose:
• AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty
and Speed reduction.
• 15 temporary Hit Points.
• Low-light vision and imprecise scent 30 feet.
• One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the
battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you
can Strike with. You’re trained with them. Your attack
modifier is +16, and your damage bonus is +9. These
attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the
enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack
modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
• Athletics modifier of +18, unless your own is higher.
You also gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:
• Ankylosaurus Speed 25 feet; Melee [one-action] tail (backswing,
reach 10 feet), Damage 2d6 bludgeoning; Melee [one-action] foot,
Damage 2d6 bludgeoning.

• Brontosaurus Speed 25 feet; Melee [one-action] tail (reach 15 feet),
Damage 2d6 bludgeoning; Melee [one-action] foot, Damage 2d8
bludgeoning.
• Deinonychus Speed 40 feet; Melee [one-action] talon (agile),
Damage 2d4 piercing plus 1 persistent bleed; Melee [one-action]
jaws, Damage 1d10 piercing.
• Stegosaurus Speed 30 feet; Melee [one-action] tail (reach 10 feet),
Damage 2d8 piercing.
• Triceratops Speed 30 feet; Melee [one-action] horn, Damage 2d8
piercing, plus 1d6 persistent bleed on a critical hit; Melee
[one-action] foot, Damage 2d6 bludgeoning.
• Tyrannosaurus Speed 30 feet; Melee [one-action] jaws (deadly d12,
reach 10 feet), Damage 1d12 piercing; Melee [one-action] tail (reach
10 feet), Damage 1d10 bludgeoning.
Heightened (5th) Your battle form is Huge and your attacks
have 15-foot reach, or 20-foot reach if they started with
15-foot reach. You instead gain 20 temporary HP, an attack
modifier of +18, a damage bonus of +6, double the damage
dice, and Athletics +21.
Heightened (7th) Your battle form is Gargantuan and your
attacks have 20-foot reach, or 25-foot reach if they started
with 15-foot reach. You instead gain AC = 21 + your level, 25
temporary HP, an attack modifier of +25, a damage bonus of
+15, double the damage dice, and Athletics +25.
DISAPPEARANCE [two-actions] SPELL 8
ILLUSION MANIPULATE SUBTLE
Traditions arcane, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 10 minutes
You shroud a creature from others’ senses. The target becomes
undetected, not just to sight but to all senses, allowing the
target to count as invisible no matter what precise and
imprecise senses an observer might have. It’s still possible
for a creature to find the target by Seeking, looking for
disturbed dust, hearing gaps in the sound spectrum, or finding

some other way to discover the presence of an otherwise-
undetectable creature.

DISGUISE MAGIC SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 item or spell effect
Duration until your next daily preparations
You alter how an item’s or spell’s magical aura appears to
effects like detect magic. You can hide the auras entirely, have
an item register as a common item of lower level, or make a
spell register as a common spell of the same or lower rank. You
can Dismiss the spell.
A caster using detect magic or read aura of a higher rank
than disguise magic can attempt to disbelieve the illusion
using the skill matching the tradition of the spell (Arcana for
arcane, Religion for divine, Occultism for occult, or Nature for
primal). Further attempts by the same caster get the same
result as the initial check to disbelieve.
Heightened (2nd) You can Cast this Spell on a creature,
disguising all items and spell effects on it.
DISINTEGRATE [two-actions] SPELL 6
ATTACK CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature, unattended object, or force
construct
Defense AC and basic Fortitude
A black tracer bolt flies toward your target, and upon making
contact intensifies into a powerful destructive beam. Make a
spell attack against the target. If you hit an object or force
construct (such as a wall of force), it’s destroyed with no save
unless it’s an artifact or similarly powerful. A single casting
can destroy no more than a 10-foot cube of matter.
If you hit a creature, it takes 12d10 damage (no damage
type) with a basic Fortitude save. If you critically hit, the target
gets a result one degree of success worse than the outcome of
its Fortitude save. A creature reduced to 0 HP is blasted to fine
powder; its gear remains.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d10.
DISPEL MAGIC [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 spell effect or unattended magic item
You unravel the magic behind a spell or effect. Attempt a
counteract check against the target (page 431). If you successfully
counteract a magic item, it becomes a mundane item of its type for
10 minutes. This doesn’t change the item’s non-magical properties.
If the target is an artifact or similar item, you automatically fail.
DISPELLING GLOBE [two-actions] SPELL 4
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Area 10-foot burst centered on one corner of your space
Duration 10 minutes
You create an immobile globe around yourself. It attempts to
counteract any spell from outside the globe whose area or
targets enter into it, as if the globe were a dispel magic spell 1
rank lower than its actual spell rank. If the counteract attempt
succeeds, it prevents only the portion of the spell that would
have entered the globe (so if the spell also has targets outside
the globe, or part of its area is beyond the globe, those targets
or that area are affected normally). You must form the sphere
in an unbroken open space, so its edges don’t pass through
any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost (though creatures
can enter the globe after the spell is cast).
DIVINE DECREE [two-actions] SPELL 7
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SANCTIFIED SPIRIT
Traditions divine
Range 40 feet; Area 40-foot emanation
Defense Fortitude; Duration varies
You utter a potent litany from your faith, a mandate that
harms those who oppose your ideals. You deal 7d10 spirit

damage to your enemies in the area; each enemy must attempt
a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is enfeebled 2 for
1 minute.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and is
enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. If you’re on your home plane and
the creature is not, the creature is sent back to its home
plane. A creature of 10th level or lower must also succeed at
a Will save or be paralyzed for 1 minute; if it critically fails,
it dies (this is a death effect).
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d10, and the level
of creatures that must attempt a second save on a critical
failure increases by 2.
DIVINE IMMOLATION [two-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE FIRE MANIPULATE SANCTIFIED SPIRIT
Traditions divine
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Defense Reflex
Divine flames scour creatures within the area. Creatures take
6d6 fire damage and 2d6 persistent fire damage. The divine
power within the flames scorches the spirit as well; a creature
takes spirit damage instead of fire damage from divine
immolation if that would be more detrimental to the creature
(as determined by the GM).
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage and no persistent
damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and persistent damage.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and double
persistent damage.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6 and persistent
damage increases by 1d6.
DIVINE INSPIRATION [two-actions] SPELL 8
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions divine
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature
You infuse a target with spiritual energy, refreshing its magic.
If it prepares spells, it recovers one 6th-rank or lower spell
it previously cast today and can cast that spell again. If it
spontaneously casts spells, it recovers one of its 6th-rank or
lower spell slots. If it has a focus pool, it regains its Focus Points,
as if it had Refocused.
DIVINE LANCE [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
ATTACK CANTRIP CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SANCTIFIED SPIRIT
Traditions divine
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature

DIVINE WRATH [two-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SANCTIFIED SPIRIT
Traditions divine
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Defense Fortitude
You channel the fury of divinity against your foes. You deal
4d10 spirit damage to enemies in the area, depending on their
Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is sickened 1.
Critical Failure The creature takes full damage and is
sickened 2; while it’s sickened, it’s also slowed 1.

UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE INCAPACITATION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration until your next daily preparations
You take command of the target, forcing it to obey you. If you
issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn’t act
until you issue a new order. The effect depends on its Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is stunned 1 as it fights off your commands.
Failure You control the target. It gains the controlled condition,
but it can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns.
On a success, the spell ends.
Critical Failure As a failure, but the target receives a new save
only if you give it a new order that is against its nature, such
as killing its allies.
Heightened (10th) The duration is unlimited.
DRAGON FORM [two-actions] SPELL 6
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Duration 1 minute
Calling upon powerful magic, you gain a Large dragon battle form.
When you Cast this Spell, choose one type of common dragon or
another type to which your GM allows access. While in this form,
you gain the dragon trait. You have hands in this battle form and
can take manipulate actions. You can Dismiss the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of
which battle form you choose:
• AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty
and Speed reduction.
• 10 temporary Hit Points.
• Speed 40 feet, fly 100 feet. You gain any of the following
Speeds the chosen dragon has, but with the listed
amount: burrow 20 feet, climb 40 feet, swim 60 feet.
• Resistance 10 against the damage type of your Dragon
Breath (see below).
• Darkvision and imprecise scent 60 feet.
• The following unarmed melee attacks, which are the
only attacks you can Strike with. You’re trained with
them. Your attack modifier is +22, and your damage
bonus is +6. These attacks are Strength based (for the
purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If
your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use
it instead. See below for more on these attacks. Melee
[one-action] jaws, Damage 2d12 piercing plus 2d6 damage of the
same damage type as your Dragon Breath (see below);
Melee [one-action] claw (agile), Damage 3d10 slashing; Melee [one-action]
tail (reach 10 feet), Damage 3d10 bludgeoning.
• Athletics modifier of +23, unless your own is higher.
• Dragon Breath [two-actions] You exhale deadly magical energy
in an area, dealing 10d6 damage to each creature in the
area with a basic save against your spell DC. The shape,
damage type, and save type match that of your chosen
dragon’s breath. If the chosen dragon’s breath can deal
more than one type of damage, choose one when you
cast dragon form. The shape is a 30-foot cone or a 100-
foot line. Once activated, Dragon Breath can’t be used
again for 1d4 rounds. Dragon Breath has the tradition
trait matching the type of dragon and the damage trait
matching the type of damage it deals, if applicable.
• Tradition Resistance If the dragon’s magical tradition
matches that of your dragon form spell, you gain
the listed ability. Arcane resistance 5 against magic;
divine resistance 10 to spirit, vitality, and void; occult
resistance 10 to mental; primal resistance 5 to physical
damage.
Heightened (8th) Your battle form is Huge, you gain a +20-foot
status bonus to your fly Speed, and your attacks have 10-foot
reach (or 15-foot reach if they previously had 10-foot reach).
You instead gain AC = 21 + your level, 15 temporary HP, an
attack modifier of +28, a damage bonus of +12, and Athletics
+28. Your Dragon Breath deals an additional 4d6 damage.
DREAM MESSAGE SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range planetary; Targets 1 creature you know by name and
have met in person
Duration until your next daily preparations
You send a message to your target’s dream. The message is
one-way, up to 1 minute of speech (roughly 150 words). If the
target is asleep, they receive the message instantly. If not, they
receive it the next time they sleep. As soon as they receive it,
the spell ends, and you know the message was sent.
Heightened (4th) You can target up to 10 creatures you know
by name and have met in person. You must send the same
message to all of them; the spell ends for each creature
individually.
DREAMING POTENTIAL SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range touch; Targets 1 willing sleeping creature
Duration 8 hours
You draw the target into a lucid dream where it can explore

the endless possibilities of its own potential within the ever-
changing backdrop of its dreamscape. If it sleeps the full 8

hours uninterrupted, when it wakes, it counts as having spent
a day of downtime retraining, though it can’t use dreaming
potential for any retraining that would require either an
instructor or specialized knowledge it can’t access within the
dream.
DUPLICATE FOE [three-actions] SPELL 7
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 enemy of level 15 or lower
Defense Fortitude; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a temporary duplicate of an enemy to fight on
your behalf. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to
disrupt the spell. The duplicate appears in an unoccupied
space adjacent to the target and has the target’s attack
modifier, AC, saving throw modifiers, Perception, and
skill modifiers, but it has only 70 Hit Points and lacks the
target’s special abilities, including immunities, resistances,
and weaknesses. It has no magic items except weapon
potency runes.
The duplicate gains the minion trait, and it can only Stride
and Strike. Its Strikes deal the target’s normal damage but
don’t apply added effects, since it doesn’t have special
abilities. The spell automatically ends if the duplicate’s Hit
Points drop to 0.
The duplicate attacks your enemies to the best of its
abilities. You can also try to give it additional instructions;
when you Sustain the spell, you can also Command a Minion
as part of your action, but the GM determines whether the
duplicate follows your command.
The duplicate is unstable, so each turn after it takes its
actions, it loses 4d6 Hit Points. It’s not a living creature, and
it can never regain its lost Hit Points in any way.
Critical Success You fail to create a duplicate.
Success The duplicate deals half damage with its Strikes
and the duration is reduced to a maximum of 2 rounds.
Failure The duplicate works as described.
Heightened (+1) The level of creature you can target increases
by 2. The duplicate has 10 more HP.

EARTHBIND [two-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE EARTH MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 flying creature

Using the weight of earth, you hamper a target’s flight, with
effects based on its Fortitude save. If the creature reaches the
ground safely, it doesn’t take falling damage.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target falls safely up to 120 feet.
Failure The target falls safely up to 120 feet. If it hits the
ground, it can’t Fly, levitate, or otherwise leave the ground
for 1 round.

ground for 1 minute.
EARTHQUAKE [two-actions] SPELL 8
CONCENTRATE EARTH MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 500 feet; Area 60-foot burst
Duration 1 round
You shake the ground, topple creatures into fissures, and
collapse structures. The GM might add additional effects in
certain areas. Cliffs might collapse, causing creatures to fall,
or a lake might drain as fissures open up below its surface,
leaving a morass of quicksand.
• Shaking Ground The ground is difficult terrain, and
creatures on it take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack
rolls, AC, and skill checks.
• Fissures Each creature on the ground must attempt a
Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and
avoid falling into 40-foot-deep fissures that open beneath
it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides require
successful DC 15 Athletics checks to Climb.
• Collapse Structures and ceilings might collapse. The GM
rolls a flat check for each (DC 16 for a sturdy structure, DC
14 for an average structure and most natural formations,
DC 9 for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher or lower
as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning
damage to each creature caught in it with a basic Reflex
save. A creature falls prone unless it critically succeeds
and falls into a fissure if it critically fails.
Heightened (10th) You create a massive earthquake that can
devastate a settlement. The range increases to half a mile
and the area to a quarter-mile burst.
ECLIPSE BURST [two-actions] SPELL 7
COLD CONCENTRATE DARKNESS MANIPULATE VOID
Traditions arcane, divine, primal
Range 500 feet; Area 60-foot burst
Defense Reflex
A globe of freezing darkness explodes in the area, dealing
8d10 cold damage to creatures in the area, plus an additional
8d4 void damage to living creatures. Each creature in the area
must attempt a Reflex save.
If the globe overlaps with an area of magical light or affects
a creature affected by magical light, eclipse burst attempts to
counteract the light effect.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and
becomes blinded by the darkness for an unlimited duration.

Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet; Area all squares in a 20-foot burst
Duration 1 minute
Plants and fungi burst out or quickly grow, entangling
creatures. All surfaces in the area are difficult terrain. Each
round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt
a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes a –10-foot circumstance
penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical
failure, it’s also immobilized for 1 round. Creatures can attempt
to Escape to remove these effects.
ENTHRALL [two-actions] SPELL 3
AUDITORY CONCENTRATE EMOTION MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 120 feet; Targets all creatures in range
Defense Will; Duration sustained
Your words fascinate your targets. You speak or sing without
interruption throughout the casting and duration. Targets
who notice your speech or song might give their undivided

attention; each target must attempt a Will save. The GM might
grant a circumstance bonus (to a maximum of +4) if the target
is of an opposing religion, ancestry, or political leaning, or is
otherwise unlikely to agree with what you’re saying.
Each creature that comes within range has to attempt a
save when you Sustain the spell. If you’re speaking, enthrall
gains the linguistic trait.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and notices that you
tried to use magic.
Success The target needn’t pay attention but doesn’t notice
you tried to use magic (it might notice others are enthralled).
Failure The target is fascinated with you. It can attempt
another Will save if it witnesses actions or speech with
which it disagrees. If it succeeds, it’s no longer fascinated
and is temporarily immune for 1 hour. If the target is
subject to a hostile act, or if another creature succeeds at a
Diplomacy or Intimidation check against it, the fascination
ends immediately.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target can’t attempt a save
to end the fascination if it disagrees with you.

broken.
EXECUTE [two-actions] SPELL 7
CONCENTRATE DEATH MANIPULATE VOID
Traditions divine, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense basic Fortitude
You point at a creature and invoke the demise of all things. The
target takes 70 void damage with a basic Fortitude save. If the

the death and void traits and gains the vitality trait, and the
target takes 70 vitality damage with a basic Fortitude save.

FABRICATED TRUTH [three-actions] SPELL 10
CONCENTRATE INCAPACITATION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions occult
Range 100 feet; Targets up to 5 creatures
Defense Will; Duration varies
Choose a single statement you want the targets to believe.
The fact could be narrow, such as “a dragon is circling
overhead and wants to kill me”; wide-reaching, such as
“all humanoids are disguised abominations”; or conceptual,
such as “if I don’t live a kinder life, I’ll be punished in the
afterlife.” The targets’ experiences color how they react
to this “truth” and how their behavior changes. If the
statement changes what they perceive, they treat the
change as a sudden revelation.
The effect of the spell depends on the targets’ Will saves.
If a target is already affected by fabricated truth, your spell
tries to counteract it. If the counteract check fails, the
outcome of the target’s saving throw can’t be worse than a
success.
Critical Success The target doesn’t believe the statement, and
it knows you tried to trick it.
Success The target doesn’t believe the statement or realize
you tried to trick it.
Failure The target believes the statement for 1 week.

Defense basic Reflex
You reach into the skies and call down an array of falling stars
that explode upon colliding with the ground. Choose for the
falling stars to be airbursts (sonic), asteroids (fire), comets
(cold), or plasma (electricity). The spell gains the trait of the
falling star type you chose. The four stars’ central 10-foot
bursts can’t overlap. Each falling star deals 6d10 bludgeoning
damage to each creature in the 10-foot burst at the center of its
area of effect before exploding, dealing 14d6 energy damage
of the type you chose to each creature in its 40-foot burst. A
creature in any of the areas attempts one basic Reflex save
against the spell no matter how many overlapping explosions
it’s caught in and can take each type of damage only once.
Heightened (+1) The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10,
and the energy damage increases by 2d6.
FALSE VISION SPELL 5

Traditions arcane, occult

Duration until your next daily preparations
You create a false image that fools any attempts to scry on
an area. Any scrying spell sees, hears, smells, and otherwise
detects whatever you wish within the area, rather than what
is actually in the area. You can Sustain the spell each round
to change the illusion as you desire, including playing out a
complex scene. If the scrying spell is of a higher rank than
false vision, the scryer can attempt a Perception check to
disbelieve the illusion, though even if they’re successful, they
can’t learn what’s truly going on in the area.
FALSE VITALITY [two-actions] SPELL 2

damage.

CONCENTRATE FIRE MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions arcane, primal

to precision damage, and weakness 5 to cold and to water. Any
creature that touches you or damages you with an unarmed
attack or non-reach melee weapon takes 3d6 fire damage.
Your unarmed attacks deal an additional 1d4 fire damage,
and your fire spells deal one additional die of fire damage (of
the same damage die the spell uses). You can cast ignite as an
innate spell; the casting is reduced from 2 actions to 1.

FIGMENT [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet
Duration sustained
You create a simple illusory sound or vision. A sound adds
the auditory trait to the spell and the sound can’t include
intelligible words or elaborate music. A vision adds the visual
trait, can be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and is clearly crude
and undetailed if viewed from within 15 feet. When you Cast
or Sustain the Spell, you can attempt to Create a Diversion
with the illusion, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to your
Deception check. If the attempt fails against a creature, that
creature disbelieves the figment.

Traditions arcane, primal
Duration 1 minute
You create a hovering shield made of fire. As long as the shield
persists, its heat grants you cold resistance 5 and makes
you immune to mild and severe environmental cold. You can
Raise a Shield with the fire shield as a normal shield to gain
a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. You can use the Shield Block
reaction (page 262) with the fire shield, which has Hardness 10,
is immune to fire, and has 40 HP (with no Broken Threshold),
and its Hardness is halved against effects that have the water
trait. If you Shield Block a melee attack that is either an
unarmed attack or made by an adjacent attacker, the attacker
takes 2d6 fire damage.

increase by 10, and the fire damage increases by 1d6.

CONCENTRATE FIRE MANIPULATE

Defense Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a fire that burns without fuel and moves to your
commands. The flame deals 3d6 fire damage to each creature in
the square in which it appears, with a basic Reflex save. When
you Sustain this spell, you can levitate the flame up to 10 feet. It
then deals damage to each creature whose space it shared at any
point during its flight. This uses the same damage and save, and
you roll the damage once each time you Sustain. A given creature
can take damage from floating flame only once per round.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.
FLY [two-actions] SPELL 4

can see. It automatically hits and deals 1d4+1 force damage.
For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell,
increase the number of shards you shoot by one, to a maximum

shard individually. If you shoot more than one shard at the
same target, combine the damage before applying bonuses or
penalties to damage, resistances, weaknesses, and so forth.

you spend.
FORESIGHT [two-actions] SPELL 9
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL PREDICTION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 hour
You gain a sixth sense that warns you of danger that might
befall the target of the spell. If you choose a creature other
than yourself as the target, you create a psychic link through
which you can inform the target of danger. This link is a mental
effect. Due to the amount of information this spell requires you
to process, you can’t have more than one foresight spell in effect
at a time. Casting foresight again ends the previous foresight.
While foresight is in effect, the target gains a +2 status bonus to
initiative rolls and isn’t off-guard against undetected creatures
or when flanked. In addition, you gain the following reaction.
Foresight [reaction] Trigger The target of foresight defends against a
hostile creature or other danger; Effect If the hostile creature
or danger forces the target to roll dice (a saving throw, for
example), the target rolls twice and uses the higher result, and
this spell gains the fortune trait. But if the hostile creature or
danger is rolling against the target (an attack roll or skill check,
for example), that hostile creature or danger rolls twice and
uses the lower result, and this spell gains the misfortune trait.
FREEZE TIME [three-actions] SPELL 10
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
You temporarily stop time for everything but yourself, allowing
you to use several actions in what appears to others to be no
time at all. Immediately after casting freeze time, you can use
up to 9 actions in 3 sets of up to 3 actions each. After each set
of actions, 1 round passes, but for only you, effects specifically
targeting or affecting you, and effects that you create during
the stoppage. All other creatures and objects are invulnerable to
your attacks, and you can’t target or affect them with anything.
Once you have finished your actions, time begins to flow again
for the rest of the world. If you created an effect with a duration
that extends beyond freeze time’s duration, such as wall of fire, it
immediately affects others again, but it doesn’t have any of the
effects that happen only when you first Cast the Spell.

Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 120 feet
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You tear open a rift to another plane, creating a portal that
creatures can travel through in either direction. This portal is
vertical and circular, with a radius of 40 feet. The portal appears
at a location of your choice on the destination plane, assuming
you have a clear idea of both the destination’s location on the
plane and what the destination looks like. If you attempt to create
a gate into or out of the realm of a deity or another similarly
powerful being, that being can prevent the gate from forming.

a corporeal or incorporeal creature.

Each creature standing on the greasy surface must
succeed at a Reflex save or an Acrobatics check against
your spell DC or fall prone. Creatures using an action to
move onto the greasy surface during the spell’s duration
must attempt either a Reflex save or an Acrobatics check
to Balance. A creature that Steps or Crawls doesn’t have
to attempt a check or save.
• Target If you Cast the Spell on an unattended object, anyone
trying to pick up the object must succeed at an Acrobatics
check or Reflex save against your spell DC to do so. If you
target an attended object, the creature that has the object
must attempt an Acrobatics check or Reflex save. On a failure,
the holder or wielder takes a –2 circumstance penalty to all
checks that involve using the object; on a critical failure, the
holder or wielder releases the item. The object lands in an

Defense Fortitude; Duration until the start of your next turn
A violent wind issues forth from your palm, blowing from the
point where you are when you Cast the Spell to the line’s opposite
end. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog
and mist, blows objects of light Bulk or less around, and pushes
larger objects. Large or smaller creatures in the area must attempt
a Fortitude save. Large or smaller creatures that later move into
the gust must attempt the save on entering.

Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature can’t move against the wind.
Failure The creature is knocked prone. If it was flying, it takes
the effects of critical failure instead.
Critical Failure The creature is pushed 30 feet in the wind’s
direction, knocked prone, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
HALLUCINATION [two-actions] SPELL 5
ILLUSION INCAPACITATION MANIPULATE MENTAL SUBTLE
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 hour
The target consistently detects one thing as another, can’t
detect something that’s there, or detects something that’s not
there, though it doesn’t alter their beliefs. You choose which
of these effects applies, and you determine the specifics of
the hallucination. For example, you could make the target see
all elves as humans, be unable to detect the presence of their
brother, see their beloved good luck charm on their person
even when it isn’t, or see a tower in the center of town.
The target can attempt an initial Will save, with effects below.
They also receive a Will save to disbelieve the hallucination
every time they Seek or directly interact with the hallucination.
For example, the target could attempt to disbelieve the
hallucination each time they interacted with an elf, bumped into
their brother accidentally, tried to check their charm, or studied
the tower. The target can attempt to disbelieve with a large
circumstance bonus in situations determined by the GM, such
as if the target attempted to climb the nonexistent tower.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature perceives what you chose until it
disbelieves, but it knows what the hallucination is.
Failure The creature perceives what you chose until it
disbelieves.
Critical Failure The creature perceives what you chose until
it disbelieves, and it trusts its false senses, taking a –4
circumstance penalty to saves to disbelieve.
Heightened (6th) Choose to either target up to 10 creatures
or change the spell’s duration to until your next daily
preparations.
Heightened (8th) Choose to either target any number of
creatures or change the spell’s duration to unlimited.

MANIPULATE VOID
Traditions divine
Range varies; Targets 1 living creature or 1 willing undead
creature
You channel void energy to harm the living or heal the

by 8.
HASTE [two-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult, primal

Traditions divine, primal
Range varies; Targets 1 willing living creature or 1 undead creature
You channel vital energy to heal the living or damage the
undead. If the target is a willing living creature, you restore
1d8 Hit Points. If the target is undead, you deal that amount
of vitality damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save.
The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell
determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.
[one-action] The spell has a range of touch.
[two-actions] (concentrate) The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you’re
healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restored

CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions divine, occult

HIDDEN MIND [two-actions] SPELL 8
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration until your next daily preparations

Powerful wards hide a creature from magic that would spy on
it or affect its mind. The target gains a +4 status bonus to saves
against mental effects. Hidden mind attempts to counteract any
detection, revelation, and scrying effects as if its spell rank were
1 higher than its actual rank. On a success, the effect functions
normally except that it detects nothing about the target and its
possessions. For instance, detect magic would still detect other
magic in the area, but not any magic on the target.
HOLY LIGHT [two-actions] SPELL 3
ATTACK CONCENTRATE FIRE HOLY LIGHT MANIPULATE
Traditions divine, primal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense AC
You shine a blazing ray of light tinged with holy energy. Make a
ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 fire damage. If the target
has the unholy trait, you deal an extra 5d6 spirit damage.
Critical Success The target takes double damage.
Success The target takes full damage.
If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or
targets a creature affected by magical darkness, holy light
attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine
whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a
line between yourself and the spell’s target.
Heightened (+1) The fire damage increases by 2d6, and the
spirit damage against unholy creatures increases by 2d6.
HONEYED WORDS [two-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions occult
Duration 10 minutes
Falsehoods pass your lips as smoothly as silk. You gain a +4
status bonus to Deception checks to Lie and against Perception
checks to discern if you are telling the truth, and you add
your level even if untrained. If the implausibility of your lies
prompts a circumstance penalty or a DC increase, reduce that
penalty by half or increase it by half.
HOWLING BLIZZARD [two-actions] TO [three-actions] SPELL 5
AIR COLD CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Area varies
Defense Reflex
Freezing winds extend from your hands, pushing away from
you with great force. If you Cast this Spell with 2 actions, it
has an area of a 60-foot cone; if you Cast this Spell with 3
actions, it has a range of 500 feet and an area of a 30-foot
burst. Each creature in the area takes 10d6 cold damage with
a basic Reflex save. Snowdrifts and icy gales fill the area until
the start of your next turn, making the area difficult terrain.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
HUMANOID FORM [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Duration 10 minutes
You transform your appearance to that of a Small or Medium
humanoid, such as a dwarf, elf, goblin, halfling, human, or orc.
You gain the humanoid trait in addition to your other traits
while in this form, as well as any trait related to the creature’s
kind (such as goblin or human). If this transformation reduces
your size, it reduces your reach accordingly (typically to 5
feet). This transformation doesn’t change your statistics in any
way, and you don’t gain any special abilities of the humanoid
form you assume. You can still wear and use your gear, which
changes size (if necessary) to match your new form. If items
leave your person, they return to their usual size.
Humanoid form grants you a +4 status bonus to Deception
checks to pass as a generic member of the chosen ancestry, and
you add your level even if you’re untrained, but you can’t make
yourself look like a specific person. If you want to Impersonate
an individual, you still need to create a disguise, though the GM
won’t factor in the difference in ancestry when determining the
DC of your Deception check. You can Dismiss this spell.
Heightened (3rd) You gain darkvision or low-light vision if the
form you assume has that ability.
Heightened (5th) You can take on the appearance of a Large
humanoid. If this increases your size, you gain the effects of
the enlarge spell.
HYDRAULIC PUSH [two-actions] SPELL 1
ATTACK CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE WATER
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature or unattended object
Defense AC
You call forth a powerful blast of pressurized water that bludgeons
the target and knocks it back. Make a ranged spell attack roll.
Critical Success The target takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage
and is knocked back 10 feet.
Success The target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and is
knocked back 5 feet.
Heightened (+1) The bludgeoning damage increases by 2d6.
HYDRAULIC TORRENT [two-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE WATER
Traditions primal
Area 60-foot line
Defense Fortitude
A swirling torrent of water manifests along a straight line, battering
creatures and unattended objects in its path and possibly pushing
them away from you. The torrent deals 8d6 bludgeoning damage.
Each creature in the area must attempt a basic Fortitude save;
unattended objects automatically fail. Creatures and objects that
fail are also knocked back 5 feet (10 feet on a critical failure).
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
HYPERCOGNITION [one-action] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE
Traditions occult
You rapidly catalog and collate information relevant to
your current situation. You can instantly use up to 6 Recall
Knowledge actions as part of Casting this Spell. For these

actions, you can’t use any special abilities, reactions, or free
actions that trigger when you Recall Knowledge.
HYPNOTIZE [two-actions] SPELL 3
ILLUSION MANIPULATE SUBTLE VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Defense Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a cloud of mesmerizing patterns and colors that
hovers in the air. Creatures are dazzled while inside the cloud.
In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it
is inside the cloud when you cast it, when it enters the cloud,
when it ends its turn within the cloud, or if it uses a Seek or
Interact action on the cloud. A creature currently fascinated
by hypnotize doesn’t attempt new saves.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure The target is fascinated by the cloud.
Critical Failure The target is fascinated by the cloud. While it
remains fascinated, it can’t use reactions.
IGNITION [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
ATTACK CANTRIP CONCENTRATE FIRE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense AC
You snap your fingers and point at a target, which begins
to smolder. Make a spell attack roll against the target’s AC,
dealing 2d4 fire damage on a hit. If the target is within your
melee reach, you can choose to make a melee spell attack with
the flame instead of a ranged spell attack, which increases all
the spell’s damage dice to d6s.
Critical Success The target takes double damage and 1d4
persistent fire damage.
Success The target takes full damage.
Heightened (+1) The initial damage increases by 1d4 and the
persistent fire damage on a critical hit increases by 1d4.
ILL OMEN [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE CURSE MANIPULATE MISFORTUNE
Traditions occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 round
The target is struck with misfortune, which throws it off
balance. The target must attempt a Will save.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure The first time during the duration that the target
attempts an attack roll or skill check, it must roll twice and
use the worse result.
Critical Failure Every time during the duration that the target
attempts an attack roll or skill check, it must roll twice and
use the worse result.
ILLUSORY CREATURE [two-actions] SPELL 2
AUDITORY CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE OLFACTORY VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 500 feet
Duration sustained
You create an illusory image of a Large or smaller creature. It
generates the appropriate sounds, smells, and feels believable
to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500
feet apart, the spell ends.
The image can’t speak, but you can use your actions to
speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your
voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception
or Performance check to mimic the creature, as determined
by the GM. This is especially likely if you’re trying to imitate a
specific person and engage with someone that person knows.
In combat, the illusion can use 2 actions per turn, which
it uses when you Sustain the spell. It uses your spell attack
modifier for attack rolls and your spell DC for its AC. Its saving
throw modifiers are equal to your spell DC – 10. It is substantial
enough that it can flank other creatures. If the image is hit by
an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.
The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe
the illusion’s attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly
affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with
a Strike, the target takes 3d4 mental damage. The illusion’s
Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn’t correspond to the
image of the monster—for example, if an illusory Large dragon
deals only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target to attempt
an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any
relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks
they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields
a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning
damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However,
illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger
other effects that require a certain damage type. The GM should
track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.
Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek
action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half
the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn’t take any
further damage from it.
Heightened (+1) The damage of the image’s Strikes increases
by 1d4, and the maximum size of creature you can create
increases by one (to a maximum of Gargantuan).
ILLUSORY DISGUISE [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 1 hour
You create an illusion that causes the target to appear as
another creature of the same body shape, and with roughly
similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds).
The disguise is typically good enough to hide their identity,
but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell changes
their appearance and voice, but not mannerisms. You can
change the appearance of its clothing and worn items, such as
making its armor look like a dress. Held items are unaffected,
and any worn item removed from the creature returns to its
true appearance.

Casting illusory disguise counts as setting up a disguise for
the Impersonate use of Deception; it ignores any circumstance
penalties the target might take for disguising itself as a dissimilar
creature, gives a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent
others from seeing through the disguise, and lets the target add
its level to such Deception checks even if untrained. You can
Dismiss this spell.
Heightened (3rd) The target can appear as any creature of the
same size, even a specific individual. You must have seen an
individual to replicate its appearance, and must have heard its
voice to replicate its voice.
Heightened (4th) You can target up to 10 willing creatures. If you
target multiple creatures, you can choose a different disguise
for each target, but none can impersonate a specific individual.
You can Dismiss each disguise individually or all collectively.
Heightened (7th) As 4th, but you can choose disguises that
impersonate specific individuals. You must have seen an
individual to replicate its appearance, and must have heard its
voice to replicate its voice.
ILLUSORY OBJECT [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 500 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Duration 10 minutes
You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object. The
entire image must fit within the spell’s area. The object appears
to animate naturally, but it doesn’t make sounds or generate
smells. For example, water would appear to pour down an illusory
waterfall, but it would be silent.
Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to
examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
Heightened (2nd) Your image makes appropriate sounds,
generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell
gains the auditory and olfactory traits. The duration increases
to 1 hour.
Heightened (5th) As the 2nd-rank version, but the duration is
unlimited.
ILLUSORY SCENE SPELL 5
AUDITORY CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE OLFACTORY VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range 500 feet; Area 30-foot burst
Duration 1 hour
You craft an imaginary scene that includes up to 10 discrete
creatures or objects of various sizes, all of which must be within
the spell’s area. These elements generate appropriate sounds and
smells, and they feel right to the touch. Elements of an illusory
scene are incapable of speech. Unlike with the illusory creature
spell, creatures in your scene lack combat abilities and statistics.
Your scene doesn’t include changes to the environment around it,
though you can place your scene within the illusory environment
of a mirage spell.
When you create the scene, you can choose to have
it be static or follow a program. Though a static scene is
stationary, it includes basic natural movement. For example,
wind blowing on an illusory piece of paper would rustle it.
A program can be up to 1 minute long and repeats when
finished. For instance, you could create a scene of two orcs
fighting each other, and the fight would go the same way
for each repetition. If you create a loop, the two fighters
end up in the same place at the start of the scene and at the
end of it, but you can smooth the program so it’s hard to
tell when the loop ends and begins. Anyone observing the
scene for more than a few minutes almost always notices it
looping. You’re unable to alter the program after you create
the illusion.
Any creature that touches any part of the image or uses
the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your
illusion. If they interact with a portion of the illusion, they
disbelieve only that portion. They disbelieve the entire scene
only on a critical success.
Heightened (6th) Creatures or objects in your scene can speak.
You must speak the specific lines for each actor when creating
your program. The spell disguises your voice for each actor.
Heightened (8th) As the 6th-rank version, and the duration is
unlimited.
IMPALING SPIKE [two-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE METAL
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Reflex; Duration 1 minute
You conjure a spike that thrusts up from the earth beneath
a target creature, potentially impaling it. The spike is made
of cold iron and deals 8d6 piercing damage. The target must
attempt a Reflex save.
Critical Success The target dodges the spike and is unaffected.
Success The target is struck by the spike and takes half damage.

Failure The target is impaled through a leg or another non-
vital body part. The creature takes full damage and, if it’s

standing on solid ground, becomes immobilized. It can
attempt to Escape (the DC is your spell DC). While it remains
impaled, it takes damage from any weakness to cold iron it
has at the end of each of its turns.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature is impaled through
a vital organ or its center of mass, taking double damage,
and it is off-guard as long as it’s impaled.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
IMPLOSION [two-actions] SPELL 9
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 corporeal creature
Defense basic Fortitude; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You crush the target by causing it to collapse in on itself,
dealing 75 damage. The first time each round you Sustain
the spell, you must choose a new target to be subject to the
same effect; the same creature can never be targeted more
than once with a single casting of this spell. You also can’t
affect more than one creature per turn with implosion. You

can’t target a creature that’s incorporeal, gaseous, or liquid, or
otherwise lacking a solid form.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 10.
INDESTRUCTIBILITY [two-actions] SPELL 10
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Duration until the start of your next turn
You sever yourself from cause and effect. For the duration of the
spell, you are immune to any effect or damage that would harm
you, excluding effects caused by artifacts, deific power, and
similarly powerful sources. You can selectively allow yourself to
be affected by anything you’re willing to have affect you.
INFUSE VITALITY [one-action] TO [three-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE VITALITY
Traditions divine
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 to 3 willing creatures
Duration 1 minute
You empower attacks with vital energy. The number of targets
is equal to the number of actions you spent casting this spell.
Each target’s unarmed and weapon Strikes deal an extra 1d4
vitality damage. (This damage typically damages only undead, as
explained on page 409). If you have the holy trait, you can add
that trait to this spell and to the Strikes affected by the spell.
Heightened (3rd) The damage increases to 2d4 damage.
Heightened (5th) The damage increases to 3d4 damage.
INSECT FORM [two-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions arcane, primal
Duration 1 minute
You envision a simple bug and transform into a Medium animal
battle form. When you Cast this Spell, choose a listed battle
form. You can decide the specific type of animal (such as such
as a ladybug or scarab for beetle), but this has no effect on the
form’s Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the animal
trait. You can Dismiss this spell.
You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of
which battle form you choose:
• AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty
and Speed reduction.
• 10 temporary Hit Points.
• Low-light vision.
• One or more attacks specific to the battle form you
choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with.
You’re trained with them. Your attack modifier is +13, and
your damage bonus is +2. These attacks are Strength
based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition). If your
unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
• Athletics modifier of +13, unless your own is higher.
You gain specific abilities based on the form you choose:
• Ant Speed 30 feet, climb 30 feet; Melee [one-action] mandibles,
Damage 2d6 bludgeoning.

dice (including persistent damage), and Athletics +20.
INTERPLANAR TELEPORT SPELL 7
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast 10 minutes; Requirements You have a planar key for the
destination plane, used as a locus

Range 5 feet; Targets up to 8 willing creatures
You and your allies traverse the barriers between planes of
existence. The targets move to another plane, such as the Plane
of Fire, the Netherworld, or the Outer Rifts. You must know the
destination plane exists and use a magic planar key created
from material from that plane as a locus for the spell. While
the planar keys for most prominent planes are uncommon, just
like the spell interplanar teleport, more obscure planes and
demiplanes often have rare or possibly even unique planar keys.
The spell is highly imprecise, and you appear 1d20×25
miles from the last place one of the targets (of your choice)
was located the last time that target traveled to the plane. If
it’s the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets,
you appear at a random location on the plane. Interplanar
teleport doesn’t provide a means of return travel, though
casting interplanar teleport again allows you to return to your
previous plane unless there are extenuating circumstances.
INVISIBILITY [two-actions] SPELL 2
ILLUSION MANIPULATE SUBTLE
Traditions arcane, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 10 minutes
Illusions bend light around the target, rendering it invisible.
This makes it undetected to all creatures, though the creatures
can attempt to find the target, making it hidden to them
instead (page 434). If the target uses a hostile action, the spell
ends after that hostile action is completed.
Heightened (4th) The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn’t end if
the target uses a hostile action.
INVOKE SPIRITS [two-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE EMOTION FEAR MANIPULATE MENTAL VOID
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Defense Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
Ragged apparitions of the dead rise to stalk the living. They deal
2d4 mental damage and 2d4 void damage to each living creature
in the area, with a basic Will save. Additionally, creatures that
critically fail the save are frightened 2 and are fleeing for 1 round.
On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the spell
each round, you can move the area up to 30 feet within the
range of the spell. Living creatures in the new area must
attempt saves with the same effects as above, except that
critically failing doesn’t make them flee.
Heightened (+2) The mental damage and void damage each
increase by 1d4.
ITEM FACADE [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 object no more than 10 feet by 10 feet
by 10 feet
Duration 1 hour
You make the target object look and feel as though it were
in much better or worse physical condition. When you Cast
this Spell, decide whether you want to make the object look
decrepit or perfect. An item made to look decrepit appears
broken and shoddy. An intact item made to look better
appears as though it’s brand new and highly polished or well
maintained. A broken item appears to be intact and functional.
Destroyed items can’t be affected by this spell. A creature that
Interacts with the item can attempt to disbelieve the illusion.
Heightened (2nd) The duration is 24 hours.
Heightened (3rd) The duration is unlimited.
JUMP [one-action] SPELL 1
MANIPULATE MOVE
Traditions arcane, primal
Your legs surge with strength, ready to leap high and far. You
jump 30 feet in any direction without touching the ground.
You must land on a space of solid ground within 30 feet of you,
or else you fall after using your next action.
Heightened (3rd) The range becomes touch, the target
changes to one touched creature, and the duration becomes
1 minute, allowing the target to jump as described whenever
it takes the Leap action.
KNOCK [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 door, lock, or container

Duration 1 minute
You make the target easier to open. Knock grants a +4 status
bonus to any creature that tries to open the target door, lock,
or container with an Athletics or a Thievery check. You can
attempt a Thievery check to open the target as part of casting
knock, and you add your level even if you’re untrained.
Knock counteracts lock.
KNOW THE WAY [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP CONCENTRATE DETECTION MANIPULATE
Traditions divine, occult, primal
In your mind’s eye, you magically reorient yourself. You
immediately know which direction is north (if it exists at your
current location), and you can choose a location you were at
within the last 24 hours and learn what direction it lies.
Heightened (3rd) You can choose a location you were at within
the last week.
Heightened (7th) You can choose a location you were at
regardless of how long ago you were there.
LAUGHING FIT [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE EMOTION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 living creature
Defense Will; Duration sustained
The target is overtaken with uncontrollable laughter. It must
attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is plagued with uncontrollable laugher. It
can’t use reactions.
Failure The target is slowed 1 and can’t use reactions.
Critical Failure The target falls prone and can’t use actions or
reactions for 1 round. It then takes the effects of a failure.
LEVITATE [two-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 unattended object or willing creature
Duration 5 minutes
You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground.
You can Sustain the spell to move the target up or down 10
feet. A creature floating in the air from levitate takes a –2
circumstance penalty to attack rolls. A floating creature can
spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate this
penalty for the remainder of its turn. If the target is adjacent
to a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it can move
across the surface by climbing (if the surface is vertical, like
a wall) or crawling (if the surface is horizontal, such as a
ceiling). The GM determines which surfaces can be climbed
or crawled across.
LIGHT [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP CONCENTRATE LIGHT MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range 120 feet
Duration until your next daily preparations
You create an orb of light that sheds bright light in a 20-
foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) in a color you
choose. If you create the light in the same space as a willing
creature, you can attach the light to the creature, causing it to
float near that creature as it moves. You can Sustain the spell
to move the light up to 60 feet; you can attach or detach it
from a creature as part of this movement.
You can Dismiss the spell. If you Cast the Spell while you
already have four light spells active, you must choose one of
the existing spells to end.
Heightened (4th) The orb sheds light in a 60-foot radius (and
dim light for the next 60 feet).
LIGHTNING BOLT [two-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE ELECTRICITY MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Area 120-foot line
Defense basic Reflex
A bolt of lightning strikes outward from your hand, dealing
4d12 electricity damage with a basic Reflex save.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d12.
LIMINAL DOORWAY SPELL 4
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE EXTRADIMENSIONAL MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range touch
Duration 8 hours
You draw a chalk doorway on an unbroken surface, which
opens into an extradimensional space. Any creature treating
the drawing as an actual door can Interact to touch the
doorknob and pass through. The warped, chalk-drawn room
beyond the door is 20 feet in width, depth, and height. The
space is unadorned and empty, with chalk lines indicating the
corners of the walls.
If the drawing is scrubbed away, the underlying surface is
broken, or a creature attempts to enter the space that would
put it over capacity, the space begins to collapse. The space
ejects one creature at random each round, depositing it on the
nearest open ground, until all creatures are returned outside.
LOCATE SPELL 3
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE DETECTION MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range 500 feet; Targets 1 specific object or type of object
Duration sustained
You learn the direction to the target (if you picked a specific
object, such as “my mother’s sword”) or the nearest target (if
you picked a type of object, such as “swords”). If the target
is a specific object, you must have observed it directly with
your own senses. If it’s a type of object, you still need to have
an accurate mental image of the type of object. If there’s lead
or running water between you and the target, this spell can’t
locate the object. This means you might find a type of object
farther away if the nearest one is behind lead or running water.

Heightened (5th) You can target a specific creature or ancestry
instead of an object, but you must have met or seen up close
the creature or ancestry you want to target.
LOCK [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 lock, or a door or container with a latch
Duration until your next daily preparations
The target’s latch mechanism clinks shut, held fast by unseen
magical wards. When you magically lock a target, you set an
Athletics and Thievery DC to open it equal to your spell DC or
the base lock DC with a +4 status bonus, whichever is higher.
Any key or combination that once opened a lock affected by
this spell does not do so for the duration of the spell, though
the key or combination does grant a +4 circumstance bonus to
checks to open the door.
If the target is opened, the spell ends. Assuming the target
is not barred or locked in some additional way, you can unlock
and open it with an Interact action during which you touch the
target. This does not end the spell. You can Dismiss this spell
at any time and from any distance.
Heightened (2nd) The duration is unlimited, but you must
expend 6 gp worth of precious metals as an additional cost.
MAD MONKEYS [two-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions primal
Range 30 feet; Area 5-foot burst
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
Magical monkey spirits fill the area as they pile and climb on
top of one another. Because the monkeys are magical spirits,
they can’t be attacked or hurt. Casting calm or a similar effect
over the monkeys makes them docile, causing them to cease
making mischief for the duration of mad monkeys.
Choose the kind of mischief your monkeys make when you
Cast the Spell. They produce the effect listed for that mischief
when you Cast the Spell and the first time each round when you
Sustain the spell. The first time each round when you Sustain
the spell, you can move the area of the monkeys by 5 feet.
• Flagrant Burglary The monkeys try to Steal any one item
from one creature in the area. Use your spell DC – 10
as the monkeys’ Thievery modifier. Their attempt relies
more on distraction than subtlety, so the victim knows
what item the monkeys were trying to take and whether
it was taken. Getting a stolen item from the monkeys—
even for the caster—requires Stealing it from them or
Disarming them, using your spell DC. When the spell
ends, any stolen items fall to the ground in any square of
the spell’s area you choose.
• Raucous Din The monkeys screech loudly, potentially
deafening creatures in the spell’s area. Each creature in
the spell’s area must attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected and is
temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is deafened for 1 round.
Critical Failure The creature is deafened for 1 minute.
• Tumultuous Gymnastics The monkeys jump and climb
all over creatures in the spell’s area, interfering with
complex movements. Each creature in the spell’s area
must attempt a Reflex save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected and is
temporarily immune for 10 minutes.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure For 1 round, the creature must succeed at a DC
5 flat check whenever it attempts a manipulate action. If
it fails this check, the action is disrupted.
Critical Failure As failure, but the monkeys cling to the
creature tenaciously, and the effect lasts until the spell
ends, even if the creature leaves the spell’s area.
MAGIC PASSAGE [two-actions] SPELL 5
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE EARTH MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Range touch; Area 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall, 10-foot-deep
section of wooden, plaster, or stone wall
Duration 1 hour
You create a visible tunnel through the wall in the chosen area,
replacing the area with empty space. If the wall is thicker than
10 feet, the tunnel ends 10 feet in. Even a small layer of metal
in the wall prevents this spell from functioning. This spell
doesn’t reduce the integrity of the structure. When the spell
ends, anyone inside the tunnel is shunted to the nearest exit.
Heightened (7th) The tunnel can be up to 20 feet deep. The
areas of the wall that contain your tunnel’s entrance appear
completely normal (unless viewed with truesight or a similar
effect), despite the tunnel’s existence. The tunnel’s entrance
functions as a solid wall, but you can specify a password or
a trigger (page 303), allowing creatures to enter freely.
MANIFESTATION [three-actions] SPELL 10
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
You spin secrets from the fundaments of magic, shaping them
into a power with nearly unlimited potential. You duplicate
a spell of 9th rank or lower of the tradition from which you
cast manifestation, or a spell of 7th rank or lower from any
tradition. Though you can normally choose only spells that
are common or to which you have access, the GM might allow
broader options.
MARINER’S CURSE [two-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE CURSE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will
You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling, unforgiving
sea. The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target becomes sickened 1. Reducing its sickened
condition to 0 ends the curse.

Failure The target becomes sickened 1 and can’t reduce its
sickened condition below 1 while the curse remains. The
curse can be lifted by 4th-rank cleanse affliction or similar
magic. Whenever the target is sickened and on the water at
least a mile from shore, it is also slowed 1.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target becomes sickened 2.
MARVELOUS MOUNT SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast 10 minutes
Range 30 feet; Targets one creature
Duration 8 hours
You conjure a Large fantastical creature to serve as a mount
for the target. The mount is the target’s minion (page 301), has
a Speed of 40 feet, and can bear the target with any carried
possessions. It can’t carry any other creature. The mount uses
the target’s AC and saves, but it’s destroyed if it takes more
than 10 damage at one time, ending the spell.
Heightened (3rd) The mount can walk on water, but it must
end its turn on solid ground or sink.
Heightened (4th) The mount has a Speed of 60 feet and can
walk on water.
Heightened (5th) The mount has a Speed of 60 feet and can
walk on water. It also has a fly Speed of 60 feet, but it must
end its turn on a surface or fall.
Heightened (6th) The mount has a Speed and fly Speed of 80 feet.
MASK OF TERROR [two-actions] SPELL 7
CONCENTRATE EMOTION FEAR ILLUSION MANIPULATE MENTAL VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature. The
effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target
might see a demon with bloody fangs, but a demon observing the
target might see a glowing angelic visage.
When any creature attempts a hostile action against the target,
the creature must attempt a Will save. It is then temporarily
immune until the end of its next turn.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature becomes frightened 2 before using its action.
Critical Failure The creature becomes frightened 2, and its action
fails and is wasted.
Heightened (8th) You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature
uses a hostile action or reaction that affects multiple targets
simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against
mask of terror.
MASSACRE [two-actions] SPELL 9
CONCENTRATE DEATH MANIPULATE VOID
Traditions arcane, divine, primal
Area 60-foot line
Defense Fortitude
You unleash a wave of death to snuff out the life force of those
in its path. Each living creature of 17th level or lower in the line
must attempt a Fortitude save. If the damage from massacre
reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points, that creature dies instantly.
If massacre doesn’t kill even a single creature, the void energy
hungrily turns backward toward you, dealing an additional 30
void damage to every living creature in the line (even those
above 17th level) and 30 void damage to you.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes 9d6 void damage.
Failure The creature takes 100 void damage.
Critical Failure The creature dies.
Heightened (10th) The spell can affect living creatures up to
19th level. Increase the damage to 10d6 on a success, and
to 115 on a failure.
MENDING SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast 10 minutes
Range touch; Targets non-magical object of light Bulk or less
You repair the target item. You restore 5 Hit Points per
spell rank to the target, potentially removing the broken
condition if this repairs it past the item’s Broken Threshold.
You can’t replace lost pieces or repair an object that’s been
completely destroyed.
Heightened (2nd) You can target a non-magical object of 1
Bulk or less.
Heightened (3rd) You can target a non-magical object of 2
Bulk or less, or a magical object of 1 Bulk or less.
MESSAGE [one-action] CANTRIP 1
AUDITORY CANTRIP CONCENTRATE ILLUSION LINGUISTIC MENTAL SUBTLE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration see below
You mouth words quietly, but instead of coming out of your
mouth, they’re transferred directly to the ears of the target.
While others can’t hear your words any better than if you
normally mouthed them, the target can hear your words as
if they were standing next to you. The target can give a brief
response as a reaction, or as a free action on their next turn
if they wish, but they must be able to see you and be within
range to do so. If they respond, their response is delivered
directly to your ear, just like the original message.
Heightened (3rd) The spell’s range increases to 500 feet.
METAMORPHOSIS [two-actions] SPELL 9
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions arcane, primal
Duration 1 minute
Harnessing your mastery of transformative magic, you hide
forms within forms. You transform yourself into any form you
could choose with a polymorph spell in your spell repertoire or

that you could prepare of 8th-rank or lower (including any 8th-
rank or lower heightened versions of spells you know). You

gain 40 temporary Hit Points rather than the amount normally
granted by the form.

You can Sustain the spell to enter a new form you haven’t
used during this metamorphosis. This replenishes your
temporary Hit Points from this spell.
MIGRATION [two-actions] SPELL 8
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions primal
Cast 10 minutes
Range 20 feet; Targets you and up to 5 willing creatures
Duration 8 hours
The targets naturally take on animal forms most fitting their
movement and environment. Each target gains a land, burrow,
climb, fly, and swim Speed of 40 feet, and can transform into a
Tiny or Small animal most appropriate for a given movement and
environment. It also gains immunity to mild, severe, and extreme
cold and heat, along with any other immunities common to the
local wildlife, at the GM’s discretion. In exploration mode, a target
can move much faster, at a travel Speed of 20 miles per hour.
A target can’t Strike, cast spells, or use most manipulate actions
in animal form, but it can resume its normal shape by Sustaining
the spell. It can Sustain the spell again to resume animal form.
MIND PROBE SPELL 5
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE LINGUISTIC MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You cast your thoughts through a creature’s mind, sifting for
information. You access the target’s memories and knowledge
unless it fends you off with a Will save.
Success The target is unaffected.
Failure Each round of the spell’s duration, you can Sustain the
spell to ask a different question and attempt to uncover
the answer. For each question, the target can attempt
a Deception check against your spell DC; if the target
succeeds, you don’t learn the answer, and on a critical
success, the target gives you a false answer that you believe
is truthful Once you’ve asked the target a given question,
asking it again, even with a separate casting of mind probe,
produces the same result.
Critical Failure As failure, and the target takes a –4 circumstance
penalty to Deception checks against your questions.
MIND READING [two-actions] SPELL 3
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE DETECTION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration 1 round or sustained up to 1 minute
With a cursory mental touch, you attempt to read the target’s
mind. It must attempt a Will save. The target then becomes
temporarily immune to your mind reading for 1 hour.
Critical Success The target perceives vague surface thoughts
from you when you Cast the Spell.
Success You find out whether the target’s Intelligence modifier
is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.
Failure You perceive vague surface thoughts from the target
when you Cast the Spell, and you find out whether its
Intelligence is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.
Critical Failure As failure, and for the duration of the spell, you
can Sustain the spell to detect the target’s surface thoughts
again. The target doesn’t receive any additional saves.
MINDLINK [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature
You link your mind to the target’s mind and mentally impart to
that target an amount of information in an instant that could
otherwise be communicated in 10 minutes.
MIRAGE SPELL 4
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast 10 minutes
Range 500 feet; Area 50-foot burst
Duration until your next daily preparations
You create an illusion that causes natural terrain to look,
sound, feel, and smell like a different kind of terrain. This
doesn’t disguise any structures or creatures in the area.
Any creature that touches the illusion or uses the Seek
action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.
Heightened (5th) Your image can also disguise structures
or create illusory structures (but still doesn’t disguise
creatures).
MISLEAD [two-actions] SPELL 6
CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You turn yourself invisible and create an illusory duplicate of
yourself. When you Sustain the spell, you can mentally dictate
a course of action for your duplicate to follow that round. Your
duplicate acts as though it had your full number of actions,
though it can’t actually affect anything in the environment.
Both the duplicate and your invisibility persist for the spell’s
duration. Performing a hostile action doesn’t end mislead’s
invisibility, just like a 4th-rank invisibility spell. A creature
that determines the duplicate is an illusion doesn’t necessarily
know you’re invisible, and one that can see your invisible form
doesn’t necessarily know your duplicate is an illusion.
If you Cast a Spell, attack, or otherwise interact with
another creature, as a part of that action you can attempt
a Deception check against observers’ Perception DCs to
convince them your duplicate used that action. This doesn’t
fool anyone who’s aware your duplicate is an illusion, nor does
it work if the attack obviously couldn’t have come from the
duplicate. For instance, if you fired a ray, you could make it
look like it came from the duplicate as long as the duplicate
was positioned appropriately, but if you attacked with a sword
and your duplicate was across the room from the target, your
Deception check would automatically fail.

MIST [three-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE WATER
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Duration 1 minute
You call forth a cloud of mist. All creatures within the mist
become concealed, and all creatures outside the mist become
concealed to creatures within it. You can Dismiss the cloud.
MOMENT OF RENEWAL [two-actions] SPELL 8
CONCENTRATE HEALING MANIPULATE
Traditions divine, primal
Range touch; Targets up to 6 creatures
The targets experience a day’s worth of recovery in an instant.
Any detrimental effects that would be gone after 24 hours
end, though this doesn’t shorten the duration of any active
spells affecting the targets. The targets regain Hit Points and
recover from conditions as if they had taken 24 hours of rest,
but they do not make their daily preparations again or gain
any benefits of rest other than healing. The targets are then
temporarily immune for 1 day.
MONSTROSITY FORM [two-actions] SPELL 8
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions arcane, primal
Duration 1 minute
You transform into the shape of a legendary monster, assuming
a Huge battle form. When you Cast this Spell, choose phoenix,
cave worm, or sea serpent. While in this form, you gain the
beast trait (for phoenix) or the animal trait (for cave worm or
sea serpent). You can Dismiss the spell.

and Speed reduction.

battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you
can Strike with. You’re trained with them. Your attack

attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the
enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack
modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
• Athletics modifier of +30, unless your own is higher.
You gain specific abilities based on the monster you choose:
• Cave Worm Speed 40 feet, burrow 30 feet, swim 20
feet; Melee [one-action] jaws (reach 10 feet), Damage 2d12+20
piercing; Melee [one-action] stinger (agile, reach 10 feet), Damage
2d8+15 piercing plus 2d6 persistent poison; Melee
[one-action] body (reach 10 feet) Damage 2d8+20 bludgeoning;
Inexorable You automatically recover from the
paralyzed, slowed, and stunned conditions at the end
of each of your turns. You’re also immune to being
immobilized and ignore difficult terrain and greater
difficult terrain.
• Phoenix Speed 30 feet, fly 90 feet; Melee [one-action] beak
(reach 15 feet), Damage 2d6+12 piercing plus 2d4 fire
and 2d4 persistent fire; Melee [one-action] talon (agile, reach
15 feet), Damage 2d8+12 slashing; Shroud of Flame
(aura, fire, primal) 20 feet. You gain an aura of fire
that extends out from you. A creature that enters or
ends its turn within the aura takes 2d6 fire damage.
A creature can take this damage only once per turn.
You can activate or deactivate this aura with a Sustain
action.
• Sea Serpent Speed 20 feet, swim 90 feet; Melee [one-action]

Swim or Stride. Each creature you’re adjacent to at any
point during your movement takes 4d8+10 slashing
damage (basic Reflex against your spell DC).
Heightened (9th) You instead gain AC = 22 + your level, 25
temporary HP, attack modifier +31, increase damage by one
damage die, and Athletics +33.
MOON FRENZY [two-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MORPH
Traditions primal
Range 30 feet; Targets up to 5 willing creatures
Duration 1 minute

A feral aspect overcomes the targets, filling them with
strength and ferocity. Targets gain 5 temporary Hit Points,
a +10-foot status bonus to their Speeds, and weakness 5 to
silver. They also grow vicious fangs and claws, which are
unarmed attacks. The fangs deal 2d8 piercing damage; the
claws deal 2d6 slashing damage and have the agile and finesse
traits. The targets use their highest weapon or unarmed attack
proficiency with these attacks, and if they have weapon
specialization or greater weapon specialization, they add this
damage as well. On a critical hit with one of these unarmed
attacks, the creature struck takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage.
The targets can’t use concentrate actions unless those
actions also have the rage trait, with the exception of Seek.
A creature can attempt to end the spell’s effect on itself by
using a single action, which has the rage trait, to attempt
a Will save against your spell DC; on a success, it ends the
spell’s effect on itself.
If a target is in the light of a full moon, it also grows by one
size if it were Medium or smaller. This increases the reach of
a Medium or Tiny creature by 5 feet.
Heightened (6th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 10, the
silver weakness to 10, and the damage dealt by the attacks
to three dice.
Heightened (10th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 20,
the silver weakness to 20, and the damage dealt by the
attacks to four dice.

attack, mountain resilience’s duration decreases by 1 minute.
Heightened (6th) The resistance increases to 10.

NATURE INCARNATE [two-actions] SPELL 10
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions primal

The primal power of the world flows through you. You

UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL PLANT TELEPORTATION
Traditions primal
Cast 1 minute
You step into a living tree with a trunk big enough for you to fit
inside it and instantly teleport to any tree within 5 miles that
also has a sufficiently large trunk. Once you enter the first tree,
you instantly know the rough locations of other sufficiently
large trees within range and can exit from the original tree, if
you prefer. You can’t carry extradimensional spaces with you;
if you attempt to do so, the spell fails.

Heightened (8th) The tree you exit can be up to 500 miles away.
Heightened (9th) The tree you exit can be anywhere on the

removed only through effects that target curses.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is stupefied 2 for 1 round.
Failure The target is stupefied 4 with an unlimited duration.
Critical Failure The target’s intellect is permanently reduced
below that of an animal, and it treats its Charisma,

under the GM’s control.

CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range planetary; Targets 1 creature you know by name
Defense Will; Duration 1 day
You send disturbing nightmares to your target. The next time

immune for 1 week.
Success The target has the nightmares but has no adverse
effects other than unpleasant memories.
Failure The target has the nightmares and awakens fatigued.

CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SONIC

A cacophonous noise blasts out, dealing 2d10 sonic damage.
Each creature must attempt a Fortitude save.

OAKEN RESILIENCE [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE PLANT WOOD
Traditions arcane, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 10 minutes
The target’s skin becomes tough, with a consistency like bark
or wood. The target gains resistance 2 to bludgeoning and
piercing damage and weakness 3 to fire. After the target takes
fire damage, it can Dismiss the spell as a free action triggered
by taking the damage; doing so doesn’t reduce the fire damage
the target was dealt.
Heightened (+2) The resistances increase by 2, and the
weakness increases by 3.
ONE WITH PLANTS [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE PLANT POLYMORPH WOOD
Traditions primal
Duration 10 minutes or 8 hours
You can either transform into a plant or merge with plant matter.
While transformed, you can’t move or affect anything outside
the plant, but you can cast spells as long as they don’t require
line of effect beyond the plant. You can Dismiss this spell.
• Merge with Plants The spell’s duration is 10 minutes. While
casting the spell, you must touch a plant with enough
volume to fit you and your possessions or the spell is
disrupted. While merged, you can hear, but not see, what’s
going on outside the plant. If the plant takes damage while
you’re inside it, you’re expelled from the plant and take

10d6 damage. Magic passage expels you without dealing
damage. The spell ends if you’re ever outside the plant.
• Turn into a Plant The spell’s duration is 8 hours. You become
a Large plant—typically a tree. Perception checks don’t
reveal your true nature, but a successful Nature or Survival
check against your spell DC reveals that you appear to be a
plant that is strangely new to the area. While in this form,
you can observe everything around you, using your normal
senses. As a plant, your AC is 20, and only status bonuses,
status penalties, circumstance bonuses, and circumstance
penalties affect you. Any successes and critical successes
you roll on Reflex saves are failures.
ONE WITH STONE [two-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE EARTH MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions arcane, primal
Duration 10 minutes or 8 hours
You can either transform into a stone or merge with stone.
This spell has the same effects as one with plants, but lets you
merge with or turn into stone. A stone you turn into has AC 23.
You can Dismiss this spell.
OUTCAST’S CURSE [two-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE CURSE MANIPULATE MENTAL MISFORTUNE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will
You afflict the target with a curse that makes its presence
abrasive and off-putting. The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice and use the
worse result whenever attempting a Deception, Diplomacy,
Intimidation, or Performance check, and creatures they
encounter have an initial attitude toward them of one step
worse (for instance, unfriendly instead of indifferent).
Failure As success, but the effect is permanent.
Critical Failure As failure, and creatures that the target
encounters have an initial attitude toward them of two
steps worse.
OVERWHELMING PRESENCE [two-actions] SPELL 9
AUDITORY CONCENTRATE INCAPACITATION MANIPULATE MENTAL VISUAL
Traditions divine, occult
Area 40-foot burst; Targets any number of creatures
Defense Will; Duration until full tribute is paid
You surround yourself with supernatural splendor, appearing
to be a god or similarly majestic being, with an appearance,
regalia, and iconography of your choice. Targets must attempt
a Will save. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then
temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target must pay tribute to you two times. Paying
tribute requires that the target spend a single action, which
has either the move trait (as they bow) or manipulate trait
(as they offer up a token in their hands). They must pay
tribute at least once on each of their turns, if possible.
While affected, the target is fascinated by you and can’t use
hostile actions against you.
Failure As success, but the target must pay tribute a total of
six times.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target must spend all its
actions paying tribute, and they cannot take other actions
until the tribute is fully paid.
PARALYZE [two-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE INCAPACITATION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You block the target’s motor impulses before they can leave
its mind, freezing target in place. The target must attempt a
Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is stunned 1.
Failure The target is paralyzed for 1 round.
Critical Failure The target is paralyzed for 4 rounds. At the
end of each of its turns, it can attempt a new Will save to
reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, or end it entirely
on a critical success.
Heightened (7th) You can target up to 10 creatures.
PARANOIA [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration 1 minute
You cause the target to see all other creatures as dire threats.
The target is stricken by intense paranoia toward all creatures
around it and must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target believes everyone it sees is a potential
threat. It becomes unfriendly to all creatures to which it
wasn’t already hostile, even those that were previously
allies. It treats no one as an ally. The spell ends after 1 round.
Failure As success, but the effect lasts 1 minute.
Critical Failure As failure, except the target believes that
everyone it sees is a mortal enemy. It uses its reactions
and free actions against everyone, regardless of whether
they were previously its allies, as determined by the GM.
It otherwise acts as rationally as it normally does and likely
prefers to attack creatures that are actively attacking or
hindering it over those leaving it alone.
Heightened (6th) You can target up to 5 creatures.
PEACEFUL BUBBLE SPELL 4
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range touch; Area 100-foot burst
Duration 24 hours
An opaque shell of drifting, iridescent runes covers the area,
creating a bubble. You can choose to make the burst smaller,

in 10-foot increments. The runes don’t block travel, but those
inside the bubble can’t perceive those outside it and vice versa.
Detection and scrying effects are likewise blocked.
Creatures sleeping within the bubble are immune to dreams
sent by spells. Those sleeping 8 hours reduce their doomed
condition by 2 instead of 1.
PEACEFUL REST [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 corpse
Duration until your next daily preparations
The targeted corpse doesn’t decay, nor can it be transformed
into an undead. If the corpse is subject to a spell that requires
the corpse to have died within a certain amount of time (for
example, raise dead), do not count the duration of peaceful rest
against that time. This spell also prevents ordinary bugs and
pests (such as maggots) from consuming the body.
Heightened (5th) The spell’s duration is unlimited, but the
spell takes one more action to cast and requires a cost
(embalming fluid worth 6 gp).
PEST FORM [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions arcane, primal
Duration 10 minutes
You transform into the battle form of a Tiny animal, such as
a cat, insect, lizard, or rat. You can decide the specific type of
animal (such as a rat or praying mantis), but this has no effect
on your Size or statistics. While in this form, you gain the animal
trait, and you can’t make Strikes. You can Dismiss the spell.
You gain the following statistics and abilities:
• AC = 15 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty
and Speed reduction.
• Speed 20 feet.
• Weakness 5 to physical damage. (If you take physical
damage in this form, you take 5 additional damage.)
• Low-light vision and imprecise scent 30 feet.
• Acrobatics and Stealth modifiers of +10, unless your own
is higher; Athletics modifier –4.
Heightened (4th) You can turn into a flying creature, such as a
bird, which grants you a fly Speed of 20 feet.
PET CACHE [one-action] SPELL 1
EXTRADIMENSIONAL MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature that is your companion
Duration 8 hours
You open your cloak or create a gap with your hands, drawing
the target into a pocket dimension just large enough for its basic
comfort. No other creature can enter this extradimensional
space, and the target can bring along objects only if they were
designed to be worn by a creature of its kind. The space has
enough air, food, and water to sustain the target for the duration.
You can Dismiss the spell. The spell also ends if you die or
enter an extradimensional space. When the spell ends, the
target reappears in the nearest unoccupied space (outside of
any extradimensional space you may have entered).
PETRIFY [two-actions] SPELL 6
CONCENTRATE EARTH MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature made of organic material
Defense Fortitude; Duration varies
The target’s body slowly turns into a stone statue. The target
must attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is slowed 1 for 1 round as stone begins to
form on their body.
Failure The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a Fortitude
save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save
has the incapacitation trait. On a failed save, the slowed
condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure) as stone
growths creep across their body. A successful save reduces
the slowed condition by 1. When a creature becomes fully
unable to act due to the slowed condition from petrify, the
spell then ends in a flash of gray light, leaving the target
petrified permanently as they become a statue. The spell
also ends if the slowed condition is removed, which causes
the stone to break off harmlessly.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target is initially slowed 2.
PHANTASMAGORIA [two-actions] SPELL 9
CONCENTRATE DEATH ILLUSION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 120 feet; Targets any number of creatures
Defense Will
You fill the targets’ minds with endless images, like countless
dreams and lives colliding with each other. The onrushing
information deals 16d6 mental damage to each target,
depending on its Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes half damage and can’t use reactions
until the start of your next turn.
Failure The target takes full damage and is confused until the
start of your next turn.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage and is
confused for 1 minute.
PHANTASMAL CALAMITY [two-actions] SPELL 6
CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Defense Will; Range 500 feet; Area 30-foot burst
A vision of apocalyptic destruction fills the mind of each
creature in the area. The vision deals 11d6 mental damage (basic
Will save). On a critical failure, the creature must also succeed
at a Reflex save or believe it’s trapped (stuck in a fissure, adrift
at sea, or some other fate in keeping with its vision). If it fails
the second save, it’s also stunned for 1 minute. It can attempt a
new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, it
disbelieves the illusion and recovers from the stunned condition.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
PHANTASMAL MINION STATISTICS

PHANTASMAL MINION [three-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SUMMON
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 60 feet
Duration sustained
You summon a phantasmal minion (see sidebar). The minion is
roughly the shape of a humanoid. You can choose to have it be
invisible or have an ephemeral appearance, but it’s obviously a
magical effect, not a real creature.
PHANTOM PAIN [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE MENTAL NONLETHAL
Traditions occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration 1 minute
Illusory pain wracks the target, dealing 2d4 mental damage
and 1d4 persistent mental damage with a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes full initial damage but no persistent
damage, and the spell ends immediately.
Failure The target takes full initial and persistent damage, and
the target is sickened 1. If the target recovers from being
sickened, the persistent damage ends and the spell ends.

persistent damage by 1d4.
PINPOINT SPELL 8
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE DETECTION MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range unlimited; Targets 1 creature or object
You learn the name of the target’s exact location (including the
building, community, and country) and plane of existence. You
can target a creature only if you’ve seen it in person, have one
of its significant belongings, or have a piece of its body, such
as a lock of hair. To target an object, you must have touched
it or have a fragment of it. Pinpoint automatically overcomes
protections against detection effects of lower rank than this
spell, even if they would normally have a chance to block it.
PLANAR PALACE SPELL 7
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE EXTRADIMENSIONAL MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute
Range 30 feet
Duration until your next daily preparations
You grow an extradimensional demiplane consisting of a spacious
dwelling with a single entrance. The entrance connects to the
plane where you Cast the Spell, appearing anywhere within the
spell’s range as a faint, shimmering, vertical rectangle 5 feet wide
and 10 feet high. You designate who can enter when you Cast the
Spell. Once inside, you can shut the entrance, making it invisible.
You and the creatures you designated can reopen the door at will.
Inside, the demiplane appears to be a mansion featuring a
magnificent foyer and numerous opulent chambers. The mansion
can have any floor plan you imagine as you Cast the Spell,
provided it fits within a space 40 feet wide, 40 feet deep, and 30
feet tall. While the entrance to the mansion is closed, effects from
outside the mansion fail to penetrate it, and vice versa, except for
interplanar teleport, which can be used to enter the mansion. You
can use scrying magic and similar effects to observe the outside
only if they’re capable of crossing planes.
A staff of up to 24 servants attends to anyone within the
mansion. These are like the servant created by the phantasmal
minion spell, though they’re visible, with an appearance you
determine during casting. The mansion is stocked with enough
food to serve a nine-course banquet to 150 people.
PLANAR SEAL [two-actions] SPELL 7
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 120 feet; Area 60-foot burst
Duration until your next daily preparations
You create a visible magical barrier that attempts to counteract
teleportation effects and planar travel into or out of the area,
including items that allow access to extradimensional spaces.
Planar seal tries to counteract any attempt to summon a creature
into the area but doesn’t stop the creature from departing when
the summoning ends.
PLANAR TETHER [two-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You stitch the target to its current plane. While the target is
affected by planar tether, the spell attempts to counteract any
teleportation effect that would move the target, or any effect that
would transport it to a different plane. Planar tether’s duration is
determined by the target’s Will save.

Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The duration is 1 minute.
Failure The duration is 10 minutes.
Critical Failure The duration is 1 hour.
PLANT FORM [two-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE PLANT POLYMORPH WOOD
Traditions primal
Duration 1 minute
Taking inspiration from verdant creatures, you transform into
a Large plant battle form. When you Cast this Spell, choose a
listed battle form. You can substitute a similar specific plant to
turn into (such as a pitcher plant instead of a flytrap), but this
has no effect on the form’s Size or statistics. While in this form,
you gain the plant trait. You can Dismiss the spell.
You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of
which battle form you choose:
• AC = 19 + your level. Ignore your armor’s check penalty
and Speed reduction.
• 12 temporary Hit Points.
• Resistance 10 to poison.
• Low-light vision.
• One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the
battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you
can Strike with. You’re trained with them. Your attack
modifier is +17, and your damage bonus is +11. These
attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the
enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack
modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
• Athletics modifier of +19, unless your own is higher.
You gain specific abilities based on the plant you choose:
• Arboreal Speed 30 feet; Melee [one-action] branch (reach 15 feet),
Damage 2d10 bludgeoning; Melee [one-action] foot, Damage 2d8
bludgeoning; you can speak in this form.
• Flytrap Speed 15 feet; resistance 10 to acid; Melee [one-action] leaf
(reach 10 feet), Damage 2d8 piercing, and you can spend
an action after a hit to Grab the target.
Heightened (6th) Your battle form is Huge, and the reach of
your attacks increases by 5 feet. You instead gain AC = 22
+ your level, 24 temporary HP, attack modifier +21, damage
bonus +16, and Athletics +22.
POSSESSION [two-actions] SPELL 7
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE INCAPACITATION MANIPULATE MENTAL
POSSESSION
Traditions occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 living creature
Defense Will; Duration 1 minute
You send your mind and soul into the target’s body, attempting
to take control. The target must attempt a Will save. If you want
to exert less control over the target, you can choose to use the
effects of any degree of success more favorable to the target.
While you’re possessing a target, your own body is
unconscious and can’t wake up normally. You can sense
everything the possessed target does. You can Dismiss this
spell. If the possessed body dies, the spell ends and you
must succeed at a Fortitude save against your spell DC or
be paralyzed for 1 hour, or 24 hours on a critical failure. If
the spell ends during an encounter, you act just before the
possessed creature’s initiative.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success You possess the target but can’t control it. You ride
along in the body while the spell lasts.
Failure You possess the target and take partial control of it.
You no longer have a separate turn; instead, you might
control the target. At the start of each of the target’s turns,
it attempts another Will save. If it fails, it’s controlled by
you on that turn; if it succeeds, it chooses its own actions;
and if it critically succeeds, it forces you out and the spell
ends.
Critical Failure You possess the target fully, and it can only
watch as you manipulate it like a puppet. The target is
controlled by you.
Heightened (9th) The duration is 10 minutes, and you can
physically enter the creature’s body, protecting your
physical body while the spell lasts.
PRESTIDIGITATION [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only)
Duration sustained
The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple
magical effects for as long as you Sustain the spell. Each time
you Sustain the spell, you can choose one of four options.
• Cook Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
• Lift Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1
foot off the ground.
• Make Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made
of congealed magical substance. The object looks crude
and artificial and is extremely fragile—it can’t be used as a
tool, weapon, or locus or cost for a spell.
• Tidy Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less.
You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of
concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk.
Prestidigitation can’t deal damage or cause adverse
conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond what is
noted above) persists only as long as you Sustain the spell.
PROJECT IMAGE [two-actions] SPELL 7
CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You project an illusory image of yourself. You must stay within
range of the image, and if at any point you can’t see the image,
the spell ends. Whenever you Cast a Spell other than one whose
area is an emanation, you can cause the spell effect to originate
from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an
illusion, it can’t benefit from spells, though visual manifestations
of the spell appear. The image has the same AC and saves as
you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.

Heightened (+2) The maximum duration you can Sustain the
spell increases to 10 minutes.
PROTECTION [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions divine, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 1 minute
You ward a creature against harm. The target gains a +1 status
bonus to Armor Class and saving throws.

all your allies in a 10-foot emanation around the target.
PUMMELING RUBBLE [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE EARTH MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Area 15-foot cone

Failure The creature takes full damage and is pushed 5 feet
away from you.

PUNISHING WINDS [three-actions] SPELL 8
AIR CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions primal
Range 100 feet; Area 30-foot radius, 100-foot-tall cylinder
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
Violent winds and a powerful downdraft fill the area, forming
a cyclone. All flying creatures in the area descend 40 feet. The
entire area is greater difficult terrain for Flying creatures, and
difficult terrain for creatures on the ground or Climbing. Any
creature that ends its turn Flying within the area descends 20
feet. Any creature pushed into a surface by this spell’s winds
takes bludgeoning damage as though it had fallen.
The squares at the outside vertical edges of the cylinder
prevent creatures from leaving. These squares are greater
difficult terrain, and a creature attempting to push through
must succeed at an Athletics check or Acrobatics check to
Maneuver in Flight against your spell DC to get through. A
creature that fails ends its current action but can try again.
QUANDARY [two-actions] SPELL 8
CONCENTRATE EXTRADIMENSIONAL MANIPULATE TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration sustained
You transport the target into an extraplanar puzzle room of
mysterious origin, locking them there. Once each turn as a
single action, the target can attempt an Occultism check,
Perception check, or Thievery check against your spell DC to
solve the puzzle. Teleportation effects can’t carry the target
outside the puzzle room unless they can also traverse the
planes, such as interplanar teleport. When the spell ends, the
target returns to the space it occupied when it was banished,
or to the nearest space if the original is now filled.
Critical Success The target solves the puzzle and escapes.
Success The target is on the right path to the solution. If it was
already on the right path, it solves the puzzle and escapes.
Failure The target makes no progress toward a solution.
Critical Failure The target makes no progress and, if it was on
the right path, it no longer is.
RAISE DEAD SPELL 6
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE HEALING MANIPULATE
Traditions divine
Cast 10 minutes; Cost gemstones worth a total value of the
target’s level (minimum 1) × 200 gp
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 dead creature of 13th level or lower
You attempt to call forth the dead creature’s soul, requiring the
creature’s body to be present and relatively intact. The creature
must have died within the past 3 days. If Pharasma has decided
that the creature’s time has come (at the GM’s discretion), or if
the creature doesn’t wish to return to life, this spell automatically
fails, but the cost isn’t consumed in the casting.
If the spell is successful, the creature returns to life with 1
Hit Point, no spells prepared or spell slots available, no points
in any pools or any other daily resources, and still with any
long-term debilitations of the old body. The time spent in the
Boneyard leaves the target temporarily debilitated, making
it clumsy 2, drained 2, and enfeebled 2 for 1 week; these
conditions can’t be removed or reduced by any means until the
week has passed. The creature is also permanently changed
by its time in the afterlife, such as a slight personality shift, a
streak of white in the hair, or a strange new birthmark.
Heightened (7th) The maximum level of the target increases to 15.
The cost increases to the target’s level (minimum 1) × 400 gp.
Heightened (8th) The maximum level of the target increases to 17.
The cost increases to the target’s level (minimum 1) × 800 gp.
Heightened (9th) The maximum level of the target increases to 19.
The cost increases to the target’s level (minimum 1) × 1,600 gp.
Heightened (10th) The maximum level of the target increases
to 21. The cost increases to the target’s level (minimum 1) ×
3,200 gp.
READ AURA CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP CONCENTRATE DETECTION MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast 1 minute
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 object
You focus on the target object, opening your mind to perceive
magical auras. When the casting is complete, you know
whether that item is magical. You or anyone you advise about
the aura gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Identify Magic on
the item. If the object is illusory, you detect this only if the
effect’s rank is lower than the rank of your read aura spell.

Heightened (3rd) You can target up to 10 objects.
Heightened (6th) You can target any number of objects.
READ OMENS SPELL 4
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE PREDICTION
Traditions divine, occult
Cast 10 minutes
You peek into the future. Choose a particular goal or activity
you plan to engage in within 1 week, or an event you expect
might happen within 1 week. You learn a cryptic clue or piece
of advice that could help with the chosen event, often in the
form of a rhyme or omen.
REGENERATE [two-actions] SPELL 7
CONCENTRATE HEALING MANIPULATE VITALITY
Traditions divine, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 willing living creature
Duration 1 minute
An infusion of vital energy grants a creature continuous
healing. The target temporarily gains regeneration 15, which
restores 15 Hit Points to it at the start of each of its turns.
While it has regeneration, the target can’t die from taking Hit
Point damage and its dying condition can’t increase to a value
that would kill it (this stops most creatures’ dying condition at
dying 3), though if its wounded value becomes 4 or higher, it
stays unconscious until its wounds are treated. If the target
takes acid or fire damage, its regeneration deactivates until
after the end of its next turn.
Each time the creature regains Hit Points from regeneration,
it also regrows one damaged or ruined organ (if any). During
the spell’s duration, the creature can also reattach severed
body parts by spending an Interact action to hold the body
part to the area it was severed from.
Heightened (9th) The regeneration increases to 20.
REMAKE SPELL 10
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Cast 1 hour; Cost a remnant of the item
Range 5 feet
You fully re-create an object from nothing, even if the object
was destroyed. To do so, you must be able to picture the
object in your mind. The remnant of the item can be small
or insignificant (even a speck of dust that remains from
disintegrate is enough). The spell fails if your imagination
relied on too much guesswork; if the object would be too large
to fit in a 5-foot cube; if the object still exists and you were
simply not aware of it; or if the object is an artifact, has a level
over 20, or has similar vast magical power.
The item reassembles in perfect condition. Even if your
mental image was of a damaged or weathered object, the new
one is in this perfected form. If the object was magical, this
spell typically restores its constant magical properties, but
not any temporary ones, such as charges or one-time uses. An
item with charges or uses per day has all of its uses expended
when remade, but it replenishes them normally thereafter.
REPULSION [two-actions] SPELL 6
AURA CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Area emanation up to 40 feet
Defense Will; Duration 1 minute
You manifest an aura that prevents creatures from approaching
you. When casting the spell, you can make the area any radius
you choose, up to 40 feet. A creature must attempt a Will save
if it’s within the area when you Cast the Spell or as soon as it
enters the area while the spell is in effect. Once a creature has
attempted the save, it uses the same result for that casting
of repulsion. Any restrictions on a creature’s movement apply
only if it voluntarily moves toward you; if you move closer to a
creature, it doesn’t then need to move away.
Critical Success The creature’s movement is not restricted.
Success The creature treats each square in the area as difficult
terrain when moving closer to you.
Failure The creature can’t move closer to you within the area.
RESIST ENERGY [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 10 minutes
A shield of elemental energy protects a creature against one
type of energy damage. Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or
sonic damage. The target and its gear gain resistance 5 against
the damage type you chose.
Heightened (4th) The resistance increases to 10, and you can
target up to two creatures.
Heightened (7th) The resistance increases to 15, and you can
target up to five creatures.
RETROCOGNITION SPELL 7
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute
Duration sustained
Opening your mind to mental echoes, you gain impressions
from past events that occurred in your current location.
Retrocognition reveals psychic impressions from events that
occurred over the course of the last day throughout the first
minute of the duration, followed by impressions from the next
day back the next minute, and so on. These echoes don’t play
out like a vision but instead reveal impressions of emotions
and metaphors that provide cryptic clues and details of the
past. If you witness a traumatic or turbulent event through
an impression, the spell ends unless you succeed at a Will
save with a DC of at least 30 and possibly as much as 50,
depending on the severity of the event. The GM determines
whether an event is traumatic and chooses the DC.
Heightened (8th) You gain impressions of events that occurred
over the previous year for each minute you concentrate,
instead of the previous day, though the details diminish,
making it harder to distinguish impressions from all but the
most major events.

Heightened (9th) You gain impressions of events that occurred
over the previous century for each minute you concentrate,
instead of the previous day, though the details diminish,
making it almost impossible to distinguish impressions from all
but the most major events.
REVEALING LIGHT [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE LIGHT MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range 120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Defense Reflex; Duration varies
A wave of magical light washes over the area. You choose
the appearance of the light, such as colorful, heatless flames
or sparkling motes. A creature affected by revealing light is
dazzled. If the creature was invisible, it becomes concealed
instead. If the creature was already concealed for any other
reason, it is no longer concealed.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The light affects the creature for 2 rounds.
Failure The light affects the creature for 1 minute.
Critical Failure The light affects the creature for 10 minutes.
REVIVAL [two-actions] SPELL 10
CONCENTRATE HEALING MANIPULATE VITALITY
Traditions divine, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets dead creatures and living creatures of
your choice within range
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
A burst of healing energy soothes living creatures and temporarily
rouses those recently slain. All living targets regain 10d8+40 Hit
Points. You return any number of dead targets to life temporarily,
with the same effects and limitations as raise dead (page 352). The
raised creatures have a number of temporary Hit Points equal to
the Hit Points you gave living creatures, but no normal Hit Points.
The raised creatures can’t regain Hit Points or gain temporary Hit
Points in other ways, and once revival’s duration ends, they lose
all temporary Hit Points and die. Revival can’t resurrect creatures
killed by disintegrate or a death effect. It has no effect on undead.
REWRITE MEMORY [two-actions] SPELL 4
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration unlimited
You alter the target’s memories by erasing a memory, enhancing
a memory’s clarity, altering a memory, or adding a false memory.
The target can attempt a Will save to resist the spell.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and realizes you tried
to alter its memory.
Success The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was
something harmless instead of rewrite memory, unless it
identifies the spell.
Failure During the first 5 minutes of the spell’s duration, you
can Sustain the spell to modify a memory once each round.
When you do, you imagine up to 6 seconds of memory to
modify, to a maximum of 5 continuous minutes of memory.
Any memories you’ve altered remain changed as long as the
spell is active. If the target moves out of range before the 5
minutes is up, you can’t alter any further memories.
Heightened (6th) You can Cast the Spell on a willing target
to suppress all memory of a particular topic, detailed in
50 words or fewer. The effect is permanent, and it patches
these omissions with an indistinct haze.
RING OF TRUTH SPELL 3
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE DETECTION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Defense Will; Duration 10 minutes
You designate an area in which lies are revealed. Creatures in
the area also take a –2 status penalty to Deception checks.
Each time a creature in the area speaks a true statement, the
soft ring of a bell sounds in the area. Creatures are aware of
the magic; therefore, they can avoid answering questions to
which they would normally respond with a lie, or they can
be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of
the truth. If a creature is in the area when the spell is cast
or later enters the area, that creature attempts a Will save.
It uses the results of this initial save if it leaves and reenters
the area.
Critical Success The target is so convincing that the bell rings
even if they lie.

Success If the target lies and succeeds at their Deception
check against all targets, the bell still rings.
Failure The bell accurately sees through their deception and
will never ring if they lie.
RUNIC BODY [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 1 minute
Glowing runes appear on the target’s body. All its unarmed attacks
become +1 striking unarmed attacks, gaining a +1 item bonus to
attack rolls and increasing the number of damage dice to two.
Heightened (6th) The unarmed attacks are +2 greater striking.
Heightened (9th) The unarmed attacks are +3 major striking.
RUNIC WEAPON [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 weapon that is unattended or wielded
by a willing creature
Duration 1 minute
The weapon glimmers with magic as temporary runes carve
down its length. The target becomes a +1 striking weapon,
gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and increasing the
number of weapon damage dice to two.
Heightened (6th) The weapon is +2 greater striking.
Heightened (9th) The weapon is +3 major striking.
SAFE PASSAGE [three-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, primal
Range touch; Area 10-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall, 60-foot-long
section of terrain
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You make passage through the area safe for a brief amount
of time. Anyone passing through the area gains the following
benefits against harmful effects of the terrain and environment,
including environmental damage, hazardous terrain, and
hazards in the area. The spell grants a +2 status bonus to AC
and saves against such effects, and resistance 5 to all damage
from such effects. Furthermore, the spell prevents anything in
the area that’s prone to collapse, such as a rickety bridge or an
unstable ceiling, from collapsing, except under extreme strain
that would collapse a normal structure of its type.
Safe passage protects only against harm, not inconvenience,
and it doesn’t reduce difficult terrain, remove the concealed
condition caused by precipitation, or the like, nor does it
protect against creatures within the spell’s area.
Heightened (5th) The granted resistance increases to 10, and
the area can be 120 feet long.
Heightened (8th) The granted resistance increases to 15, and
the area can be 500 feet long.
SANCTUARY [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions divine, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 minute
You ward a creature with protective energy that deters attacks.
Creatures attempting to attack the target must attempt a Will
save each time. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends.
Critical Success Sanctuary ends.
Success The creature can attempt its attack and any other attacks
against the target this turn.
Failure The creature can’t attack the target and wastes the action.
It can’t attempt further attacks against the target this turn.
Critical Failure The creature wastes the action and can’t attempt
to attack the target for the rest of sanctuary’s duration.
SCOUTING EYE SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SCRYING
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Cast 1 minute
Range see text
Duration sustained
You create an invisible, floating eye, 1 inch in diameter, at a
location you can see within 500 feet. It sees in all directions
with your normal visual senses and continuously transmits
what it sees to you.
The first time you Sustain the spell each round, you can
either move the eye up to 30 feet, seeing only things in front

of the eye, or move it up to 10 feet, seeing everything in all
directions around it. There is no limit to how far from you the
eye can move, but the spell ends immediately if you and the
eye ever cease to be on the same plane of existence. You can
attempt Seek actions through the eye if you want to attempt
Perception checks with it. Any damage dealt to the eye
destroys it and ends the spell.
SCRYING SPELL 6
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SCRYING
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range planetary; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration sustained up to 10 minutes
You magically spy on a creature of your choice. Scrying
works like clairvoyance (page 320), except that the image
you receive is less precise, insufficient for teleport and similar
spells. Instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500
feet, you instead create an eye that manifests just above the
target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching
one of its possessions or a piece of its body. If you haven’t met
the target in person, scrying’s DC is 2 lower, and if you are
unaware of the target’s identity (perhaps because you found
an unknown creature’s fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead
10 lower.
The effect of scrying depends on the target’s Will save.
Critical Success The spell fails and the target is temporarily
immune for 1 week. The target also gains a glimpse of you
and learns its rough distance and direction from you.
Success The spell fails and the target is temporarily immune
for 1 day.
Failure The spell succeeds.
Critical Failure The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the
target if it moves, traveling up to 60 feet per round.
SEE THE UNSEEN [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE REVELATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Duration 10 minutes
Your gaze pierces through illusions and finds invisible
creatures and spirits. You can see invisible creatures as
though they weren’t invisible, although their features are
blurred, making them concealed and difficult to identify.
You can also see incorporeal creatures, like ghosts, phased
through an object from within 10 feet of an object’s surface
as blurry shapes seen through those objects. Subtler clues
also grant you a +2 status bonus to checks you make to
disbelieve illusions.
Heightened (5th) This spell has a duration of 8 hours.
SEIZE SOUL [two-actions] SPELL 9
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE UNHOLY
Traditions divine, occult
Requirements item worth at least the target’s level × 100 gp
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature that died within the last minute
Duration unlimited
You trap the target’s soul in the item before the soul can pass on
to the afterlife. The item used to contain the soul can be anything
as long as it’s of the appropriate value. The item has AC 16 and
its normal Hardness and HP. Destroying (not just breaking) an
item or counteracting seize soul releases the soul to the afterlife.
While the soul is in the item, the target can’t be returned to
life through any means, even powerful magic such as a wish
ritual. If the item is destroyed or seize soul is counteracted on
the item, the soul is freed. An item can’t hold more than one
soul, and any attempt wastes the spell.
You can also target an item that has had a soul trapped it
in with a second casting of seize soul, which destroys the item
and either releases the soul or relocates it to a different item,
whichever you choose. This fails if the target is an artifact or
the trapped soul is a creature of 19th level or higher.
SENDING [three-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range planetary; Targets 1 creature you know well
You send the creature a mental message of 25 words or fewer,
and it can respond immediately with its own message of 25
words or fewer.
SHADOW BLAST [two-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SHADOW
Traditions divine, occult
Range varies; Area varies
Defense basic Reflex or Will (target’s choice)
You shape the shadow substance of the Netherworld into a
blast. Choose acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, force,
piercing, slashing, sonic, or spirit damage, and choose a 30-foot
cone, a 15-foot burst within 120 feet, or a 50-foot line. The blast
deals 6d8 damage of the type you chose to each creature in
the area.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d8.
SHAPE STONE [two-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE EARTH MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Range touch; Targets cube of stone 10 feet across or smaller
You shape the stone into a rough shape of your choice. The
shaping process is too crude to produce intricate parts, fine
details, moving pieces, or the like. Any creatures standing atop
the stone when you reshape it must each attempt a Reflex
save or Acrobatics check.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature falls prone atop the stone.
Critical Failure The creature falls off the stone (if applicable)
and lands prone.
SHAPE WOOD [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE PLANT WOOD
Traditions arcane, primal
Range touch; Targets an unworked piece of wood up to 20 cubic
feet in volume

You shape the wood into a rough shape of your choice. The
shaping power is too crude to produce with intricate parts, fine
details, moving pieces, or the like. You can’t use this spell to
enhance the value of the wooden object you are shaping.
SHARE LIFE [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions divine
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 10 minutes
You forge a temporary link between the target’s life essence
and your own. The target takes half damage from all effects
that deal Hit Point damage, and you take the remainder of the
damage. When you take damage through this link, you don’t
apply any resistances, weaknesses, or other abilities you have
to that damage; you simply take that amount of damage. The
spell ends if the target is ever more than 30 feet away from you.
If either you or the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points, any damage
from this spell is resolved and then the spell ends.
SHATTER [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SONIC
Traditions occult, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 unattended object
A high-frequency sonic attack shatters a nearby object. You deal
2d10 sonic damage to the object, ignoring the object’s Hardness
if it is 4 or lower.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d10, and the
Hardness the spell ignores increases by 2.
SHIELD [one-action] CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP CONCENTRATE FORCE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Duration until the start of your next turn
You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as using the
Raise a Shield action (page 419), giving you a +1 circumstance
bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, but it doesn’t
require a hand to use.
While the spell is in effect, you can use the Shield Block
reaction (page 262) with your magic shield. The shield has
Hardness 5. You can use the spell’s reaction to reduce damage
from any spell or magical effect, even if it doesn’t deal physical
damage. After you use Shield Block, the spell ends and you can’t
cast it again for 10 minutes.
Heightened (+2) The shield’s Hardness increases by 5.
SHRINK [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE POLYMORPH
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 5 minutes
You warp space to make a creature smaller. The target shrinks
to become Tiny in size. Its equipment shrinks with it but
returns to its original size if removed. The creature’s reach
changes to 0 feet. This spell has no effect on a Tiny creature.
Heightened (6th) The spell can target up to 10 creatures.
SIGIL [two-actions] CANTRIP 1
CANTRIP CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature or object
Duration unlimited (see below)
You harmlessly place your unique magical sigil, which is about 1
square inch in size, on the targeted creature or object. The mark
can be visible or invisible, and you can change it from one state
to another by using an Interact action to touch the target. The
mark can be scrubbed or scraped off with 5 minutes of work. If
it’s on a creature, it fades naturally over the course of a week.
The time before the mark fades increases depending on your
heightened rank.
Heightened (3rd) The sigil instead fades after 1 month.
Heightened (5th) The sigil instead fades after 1 year.
Heightened (7th) The sigil never fades.
SILENCE [two-actions] SPELL 2
ILLUSION MANIPULATE SUBTLE
Traditions divine, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 1 minute
The target makes no sound, preventing creatures from noticing
it using hearing alone. The target can’t use sonic attacks, nor
can it use auditory actions. This also prevents the target from
casting spells due to the magical words involved in casting, with
the exception of subtle spells.
Heightened (4th) The spell creates an aura in a 10-foot emanation
around the touched creature, silencing all sound in or passing
through it. While within the aura, creatures are subject to the
same effects as the target. Depending upon the position of
the effect, a creature might notice the lack of sound reaching
it (blocking off the noise coming from a party, for example).
SLEEP [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE INCAPACITATION MANIPULATE MENTAL SLEEP
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Area 5-foot burst
Defense Will
Each creature in the area becomes drowsy, possibly nodding
off. A creature that falls unconscious from this spell doesn’t fall
prone or release what it’s holding. This spell doesn’t prevent
creatures from waking up due to a successful Perception check,
limiting its utility in combat.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes a –1 status penalty to Perception
checks for 1 round.
Failure The creature falls unconscious. If it’s still unconscious
after 1 minute, it wakes up automatically.
Critical Failure The creature falls unconscious. If it’s still
unconscious after 1 hour, it wakes up automatically.
Heightened (4th) The creatures fall unconscious for 1 round on
a failure or 1 minute on a critical failure. They fall prone and
release what they’re holding, and they can’t attempt Perception
checks to wake up. When the duration ends, the creature is
sleeping normally instead of automatically waking up.

SLITHER [three-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SHADOW
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 120 feet; Area 20-foot burst
Defense Reflex; Duration 1 minute
A mass of snakes made of shadow rise up to capture creatures
in the area. Each creature in the area when you Cast the Spell
takes 3d6 piercing damage and 1d6 persistent poison damage
from a biting snake, and it’s grabbed or restrained depending
on its Reflex save. A creature that ends its turn in the area must
also attempt this save, even if it’s already grabbed or restrained
by the snakes. You can Dismiss the spell.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is grabbed by a
snake. The snakes’ Escape DC is equal to your spell DC. A
creature can attack a snake to release the creature. A snake’s
AC is equal to your spell DC, and it’s destroyed if it takes 12 or
more damage at once. New snakes continually regrow as long
as the spell lasts, so destroying snakes doesn’t prevent slither
from capturing more creatures.
Critical Failure As failure, but the creature takes double
damage and is restrained by a snake.
Heightened (+2) The persistent poison damage increases by
1d6 and snake HP increases by 6.
SLOW [two-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Fortitude; Duration varies
You dilate the flow of time around the target, slowing its actions.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is slowed 1 for 1 round.
Failure The target is slowed 1 for 1 minute.
Critical Failure The target is slowed 2 for 1 minute.
Heightened (6th) You can target up to 10 creatures.
SOOTHE [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE EMOTION HEALING MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 1 minute
You grace the target’s mind, boosting its mental defenses and
healing its wounds. The target regains 1d10+4 Hit Points when
you Cast the Spell and gains a +2 status bonus to saves against
mental effects for the duration.
Heightened (+1) The amount of healing increases by 1d10+4.
SOUND BODY [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE HEALING MANIPULATE VITALITY
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature
You send a surge of healing energy to restore the target’s body.
Attempt to counteract (page 431) an effect of your choice
imposing one of these conditions on the target: blinded, dazzled,
deafened, enfeebled, or sickened. If you didn’t counteract the
effect, but you would have if its counteract rank were 2 lower,
instead suppress the effect until the beginning of your next
turn. The effect’s duration doesn’t elapse while it’s suppressed.
This spell can’t counteract or suppress curses, diseases, or
conditions that are part of the target’s normal state.
Heightened (4th) Add drained to the list of conditions.
Heightened (8th) Add stunned to the list of conditions.
SPEAK WITH ANIMALS [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions primal
Duration 1 hour
You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the
Diplomacy skill with animals. The spell doesn’t make them
more friendly than normal. Cunning animals are likely to be
terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones often make inane
comments.
SPEAK WITH PLANTS [two-actions][two-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE PLANT WOOD
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Duration 1 hour
You can ask questions of and receive answers from plants
and fungi, but the spell doesn’t make them more friendly or
intelligent than normal. Most normal plants and fungi have
a distinctive view of the world around them, so they don’t
recognize details about creatures or know anything about
the world beyond their immediate vicinity. Cunning plant or
fungus monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while less
intelligent ones often make inane comments.
Heightened (4th) The duration is 8 hours.
SPEAK WITH STONES [two-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE EARTH MANIPULATE
Traditions divine, occult, primal
Duration 1 hour
You can ask questions of and receive answers from natural
or worked stone. While stone is not intelligent, you speak
with the natural spirits of the stone, which have a personality
colored by the type of stone, as well as by the type of structure
the stone is part of, for worked stone. A stone’s perspective,
perception, and knowledge give it a worldview different
enough from a human’s that it doesn’t consider the same
details important. Stones can mostly answer questions about
creatures that touched them in the past and what is concealed
beneath or behind them.
Heightened (6th) The duration is 8 hours.
SPELLWRACK [two-actions] SPELL 6
CONCENTRATE CURSE FORCE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will
You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy
in harmful surges. The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.

Success Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with
a duration, the target takes 2d12 persistent force damage.
Each time it takes persistent force damage from spellwrack,
it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1
round. Only a successful Arcana check against your spell DC
can help the target recover from the persistent damage; the
curse and the persistent damage end after 1 minute.
Failure As success, but the curse and persistent damage do
not end on their own.
Critical Failure As failure, but the persistent force damage is 4d12.
SPIDER STING [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE POISON
Traditions arcane, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Defense Fortitude
You magically duplicate a spider’s venomous sting. You deal
1d4 piercing damage to the touched creature and afflict it with
spider venom. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes 1d4 poison damage.
Failure The target is afflicted with spider venom at stage 1.
Critical Failure The target is afflicted with spider venom at stage 2.
Spider Venom (poison) Level 1; Maximum Duration 4 rounds;

SPIRIT LINK [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE HEALING MANIPULATE SPIRIT
Traditions divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 10 minutes
You form a spiritual link with another creature, taking in its pain.
When you Cast this Spell and at the start of each of your turns,
if the target is below maximum Hit Points, it regains 2 Hit Points
(or the difference between its current and maximum Hit Points, if
that’s lower). You lose as many Hit Points as the target regained.
This is a spiritual transfer, so no effects apply that would
increase the Hit Points the target regains or decrease the Hit
Points you lose. This transfer also ignores any temporary Hit
Points you or the target have. Since this effect doesn’t involve
vitality or void energy, spirit link works even if you or the target
is undead. While the duration persists, you gain no benefit from
regeneration or fast healing. You can Dismiss this spell, and if
you’re ever at 0 Hit Points, spirit link ends automatically.
Heightened (+1) The number of Hit Points transferred each time
increases by 2.
SPIRITUAL ARMAMENT [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SANCTIFIED SPIRIT
Traditions divine, occult
Range 120 feet; Target 1 creature
Defense AC; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a ghostly, magical echo of one weapon you’re
wielding or wearing and fling it. Attempt a spell attack roll
against the target’s AC, dealing 2d8 damage on a hit (or double
damage on a critical hit). The damage type is the same as the
chosen weapon (or any of its types for a versatile weapon).
The attack deals spirit damage instead if that would be more
detrimental to the creature (as determined by the GM). This
attack uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty.
After the attack, the weapon returns to your side. If you
sanctify the spell, the attacks are sanctified as well.
Each time you Sustain the spell, you can repeat the attack
against any creature within 120 feet.
Heightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d8.
SPIRITUAL GUARDIAN [two-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SANCTIFIED SPIRIT
Traditions divine
Range 120 feet
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
A Medium guardian made of magical force appears in
an unoccupied space in range. The spiritual guardian is
translucent and wields a ghostly echo of one weapon you’re
wielding or wearing. If you have a deity, the guardian takes
the form of one of your deity’s attendants or servitors. If you
sanctify the spell, the guardian’s attacks are sanctified as well.
Creatures can move through the guardian’s space but can’t
end their movement in it. You and your allies can flank with
the guardian. The guardian doesn’t have any other attributes
a creature would normally have, aside from 50 Hit Points that
it can’t recover by any means and that it can lose only when
protecting a creature (see below).
When you Cast the Spell and each time you Sustain it, you
can have the guardian move to any unoccupied space within
120 feet of you and either attack or protect.
• Attack The guardian makes a melee spell attack against
an adjacent creature, dealing 3d8 damage on a hit (or
double damage on a critical hit). The damage type is the
same as the chosen weapon (or any of its types for a
versatile weapon). The attack deals spirit damage instead
if that would be more detrimental to the creature (as
determined by the GM). This attack uses and contributes
to your multiple attack penalty.
• Protect The guardian protects a creature of your choice.
Each time the chosen creature would take damage and
the guardian is adjacent to it, the guardian takes the
first 10 damage instead of the ally. This protection lasts
until you command the guardian to attack or to protect a
different creature, or the guardian is destroyed.
Heightened (+2) The guardian’s damage increases by 1d8, and
its Hit Points increase by 20.

SUBCONSCIOUS SUGGESTION [two-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE INCAPACITATION LINGUISTIC MANIPULATE MENTAL SUBTLE
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You implant a subconscious suggestion deep within the
target’s mind for them to follow when a trigger you specify
occurs (as described on page 303). You suggest a course of
action to the target. Your directive must be phrased in such
a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target,
and it can’t be self-destructive or obviously against the
target’s self-interest. The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and knows you tried
to control it.
Success The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking
to them normally, not casting a spell on them.
Failure The suggestion remains in the target’s subconscious
until the next time you prepare. If the trigger occurs
before then, the target immediately follows your
suggestion. The effect has a duration of 1 minute, or
until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the
suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious
negative effects.
Critical Failure As failure, but the duration is 1 hour.
Heightened (9th) You can target up to 10 creatures.
THE SUMMON TRAIT

Spells with the summon trait can conjure creatures, typically
ones with a particular trait. Such creatures can be found in
Monster Core and similar books. Unless noted otherwise,
the creature must be common, it gains the summoned trait
(page 301), and it must appear in an unoccupied space
in range large enough to contain it. The highest level of
creature the spell can summon depends on the rank of the
spell, as listed below. The spell can still summon a creature
of a lower level if you so choose. These rules apply only to
spells that have the summon trait; other spells that call or
conjure items or beings but that don’t have the trait, like
summon instrument, work as explained in the spell.

the target’s self-interest. The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected and knows you tried
to control it using a spell.

your choice imposing one of these conditions on the target:

TALKING CORPSE SPELL 4
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions divine, occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range touch; Targets 1 corpse
Defense Will; Duration 10 minutes
You grant the target corpse a semblance of life, which it uses to
speak the answers to three questions posed to it. This spell calls
on the physical body’s latent memories rather than summoning
back the deceased’s spirit, so the corpse must be mostly intact
for the spell to function. The more damage the corpse has
taken, the more inaccurate or patchwork its answers are, and
it must have a throat and mouth to speak at all. If anyone has
previously cast this spell on the corpse in the last week, the
spell automatically fails. The corpse can attempt a Will save
to resist answering the questions using the statistics of the
original creature at its time of death, with the following effects.
Critical Success The target can lie or refuse to answer, and the
target’s spirit haunts you for 24 hours, bothering you and
causing you to be unable to gain any rest for that time.
Success The target can provide false information or refuse to
answer your questions.
Failure The target must answer truthfully, but its answers can
be brief, cryptic, and repetitive. It can still mislead you or
attempt to stall so that the spell’s duration runs out before
you can ask all your questions.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target’s answers are more
direct and less repetitive, though still cryptic. It takes a –2
status penalty to Deception checks to deceive or mislead you.

1 round. It can attempt to Escape against your spell DC to
remove the penalty and the immobilized condition.

Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill any
bodies of water in the area. Any creature moving on the land,
or Climbing or Swimming within the creepers, takes a –10-foot
circumstance penalty to its Speeds while in the area. Once per
round, you can Sustain the spell to make a vine lash out from
any square within the expanse of creepers. This vine has a 15-
foot reach. Make a melee spell attack roll against the target; on
a success, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes
it immobilized for 1 round or until the creature Escapes (against
your spell DC), whichever comes first.

spell ends, the object falls.

target an unattended object with a Bulk of 1 or less.

piercing, or slashing damage—as appropriate for the object you
hurled. No specific traits or magic properties of the hurled item
affect the attack or the damage.
Critical Success You deal double damage.
Success You deal full damage.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d6.
TELEPATHY [two-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE LINGUISTIC MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Duration 10 minutes
You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30
feet. Once you establish a connection by communicating with a
creature, the communication is two-way. You can communicate
with only creatures that share a language with you.
Heightened (6th) You can communicate telepathically with
creatures using shared mental imagery even if you don’t
share a language; telepathy loses the linguistic trait.

UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 10 minutes
Range 100 miles; Targets you and up to 4 targets touched,
either willing creatures or objects roughly the size of a
creature
You and the targets are instantly transported to any location
within range, as long as you can identify the location precisely
both by its position relative to your starting position and
by its appearance (or other identifying features). Incorrect
knowledge of the location’s appearance usually causes the spell
to fail, but it could instead lead to teleporting to an unwanted
location or some other unusual mishap determined by the
GM. Teleport is not precise over great distances. The targets
appear at a distance from the intended destination equal to
roughly 1 percent of the total distance traveled, in a direction
determined by the GM. For short journeys, this lack of precision
is irrelevant, but for long distances this could be up to 1 mile.
Heightened (7th) You and the other targets can travel to any
location within 1,000 miles.

Heightened (8th) You and the other targets can travel to any
location on the same planet. If you travel more than 1,000
miles, you arrive only 10 miles off target.

location on another planet within the same solar system. If
you have accurate knowledge of the location’s position and
appearance, you arrive on the new planet 100 miles off target.
Heightened (10th) As the 9th-rank version, but you and the
other targets can travel to any planet within the same
galaxy.
THUNDERSTRIKE [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE ELECTRICITY MANIPULATE SONIC
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature

You call down a tendril of lightning that cracks with thunder,
dealing 1d12 electricity damage and 1d4 sonic damage to the

TRANSLATE [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 hour
The target can understand the meaning of a single language it
is hearing or reading when you Cast the Spell. This doesn’t let
it understand codes, language couched in metaphor, and the
like (subject to GM discretion). If the target can hear multiple
languages and knows that, it can choose which language to
understand; otherwise, choose one of the languages randomly.
Heightened (3rd) The target can also speak the language.
Heightened (4th) You can target up to 10 creatures, and
targets can also speak the language.
TRANSLOCATE [two-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 120 feet
You instantly transport yourself and any items you’re wearing
and holding from your current space to an unoccupied space
within range you can see. If this would bring another creature
with you—even if you’re carrying it in an extradimensional
container—the spell is lost.
Heightened (5th) The range increases to 1 mile. You don’t need
to be able to see your destination, as long as you have been
there in the past and know its relative location and distance
from you. You are then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
TREE OF SEASONS [two-actions] SPELL 6
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE PLANT WOOD
Traditions primal

up to 30 feet as part of the same action or do so with a separate
Interact action later. When thrown, a pod explodes in a 5-foot
burst, dealing 6d6 damage with a basic Reflex save against your
spell DC. The damage type depends on the season of the pod:
electricity for spring, fire for summer, poison for autumn, or cold
for winter. When the spell ends, the tree withers away and any
remaining pods rot, leaving behind non-magical seeds.
Heightened (+1) The burst’s damage increases by 1d6.
TRUE TARGET [one-action] SPELL 7
CONCENTRATE FORTUNE PREDICTION
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 60 feet; Targets 4 creatures
Duration until the start of your next turn
You delve into the possible futures of the next few seconds to
understand all the ways your foe might avoid harm, then cast
out that vision to those around you. Designate a creature. The
first time each target makes an attack roll against that creature
during true target’s duration, the attacker rolls twice and uses
the better result. The attacker also ignores circumstance
penalties to the attack roll and any flat check required due to
the designated creature being concealed or hidden.
TRUESIGHT [two-actions] SPELL 6
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE REVELATION
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Duration 10 minutes
You see things within 60 feet as they actually are. The GM
rolls a secret counteract check against any illusion, morph,
or polymorph effect in the area, but only for the purpose of
determining whether you see through it (for instance, if the
check succeeds against a polymorph spell, you can see the
creature’s true form, but you don’t end the polymorph spell).
TRUESPEECH [two-actions] SPELL 5
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 hour

The target can understand all words regardless of language
and also speak the languages of other creatures. When in a

can choose a creature and speak in a language that creature
understands, even if the target doesn’t know what language
that is.
Heightened (7th) The duration is 8 hours.
UMBRAL JOURNEY SPELL 5
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SHADOW TELEPORTATION
Traditions arcane, occult
Cast 1 minute
Range touch; Targets you and up to 10 willing creatures touched
Duration 8 hours
You move partially into the Netherworld, using its warped
nature to speed your travels. Each hour, you cover roughly
as much ground as you normally would in 3 days (page 438).
The landmarks are vague and symbolic rather than concrete,
leaving you within a mile of your intended destination when
you Dismiss the spell or its duration ends.

CONCENTRATE INCAPACITATION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
The target is overcome with an all-consuming urge to dance.

use reactions. It also can’t use move actions except to dance,
using the Stride action to move up to half its Speed.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.

spend at least 1 action each turn dancing.

MENTAL
Traditions occult
Range 120 feet; Targets up to 5 creatures
Defense Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
Fleeting notes of a strange and unnatural song fill the air,
overtaking the mind. Each target must attempt a Will save
when you Cast the Spell, and again the first time you Sustain
the spell each round. A creature needs to attempt only one
save against the song each round, and you have to keep the
same targets when you Sustain the spell.

subsequent rounds, and is temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Success The target is unaffected this round, but it can be
affected on subsequent rounds.

UNFETTERED MOVEMENT [two-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature touched
Duration 10 minutes
You repel hindrances that would affect a creature. While under
this spell’s effect, the target ignores effects that would give them
a circumstance penalty to Speed. When they attempt to Escape
an effect that has them immobilized, grabbed, or restrained,
they automatically succeed unless the effect is magical and of a
higher rank than the unfettered movement spell.
UNFETTERED PACK [two-actions] SPELL 7
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions primal
Range 30 feet; Targets up to 10 creatures

from environmental properties.
UNRELENTING OBSERVATION [two-actions] SPELL 8
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE SCRYING
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 100 feet; Area 20-foot burst; Targets 1 creature or
object tracked and up to 5 other willing creatures
Duration varies
This spell grants perfect sight based on scrying, allowing several
willing targets to track the exact movements or position of one
creature or object. Choose one target creature or object in the
area to be tracked. It becomes the sensor for the spell. Up to
five willing creatures of your choice in the area can see a ghostly
image of this creature or object when it’s out of their sight. They
can perceive the creature or object perfectly, allowing them to
ignore the concealed or invisible condition, though physical
barriers still provide cover.
The tracking creatures can see the tracked creature or object
through all barriers other than lead or running water, which block
their vision. Distance doesn’t matter, though the creature or
object might move so far away it becomes too small to perceive.
The tracking creatures don’t see any of the environment around
the target, though they do see any gear a creature is wearing or
holding, and they can tell if it removes objects from its person.
If the target to be tracked is willing, the duration is 1 hour. If
they’re unwilling, the target must attempt a Will save.

Critical Success The creature or object is unaffected.
Success As described, and the duration is 1 minute.
Failure As described, and the duration is 1 hour.

your outstretched arms. You deal 12d6 void damage to living
creatures in the area with a basic Fortitude save.

single creature takes from this spell; calculate these temporary
Hit Points using the creature that took the most damage. You

Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d6.
VANISHING TRACKS [two-actions] SPELL 1
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE

Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 5 minutes
The target transforms into a vaporous state. In this state, the
target is amorphous. It loses any item bonus to AC and all other
effects and bonuses from armor, and it uses its proficiency
modifier for unarmored defense. It gains resistance 8 to physical
damage and is immune to precision damage. It can’t cast spells,
activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate
trait. It gains a fly Speed of 10 feet and can slip through tiny
cracks. The target can Dismiss the spell.
VEIL OF PRIVACY SPELL 3
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult, primal
Cast 10 minutes
Range touch; Targets 1 creature or object
Duration 8 hours
You erect protective wards that make the target difficult to
detect via magic. Veil of privacy attempts to counteract all
detection, revelation, and scrying effects used against the target
or the target’s gear throughout the duration, counting cantrips
as 1st-rank spells for this purpose. Successfully counteracting a
spell that targets an area or multiple targets negates the effects
for only veil of privacy’s target.
VENTRILOQUISM [two-actions] SPELL 1
AUDITORY CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal
Duration 10 minutes
Whenever you speak or make any other sound vocally, you can
make your vocalization seem to originate from somewhere else
within 60 feet, and you can change that apparent location freely
as you vocalize. Any creature that hears the sound can attempt
to disbelieve your illusion.
Heightened (2nd) The spell’s duration increases to 1 hour, and
you can also change the tone, quality, and other aspects
of your voice. Before a creature can attempt to disbelieve
your illusion, it must actively attempt a Perception check or
otherwise use actions to interact with the sound.

ILLUSION INCAPACITATION MANIPULATE SUBTLE VISUAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 120 feet; Area 10-foot burst
Defense Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a pattern of lights that pulses with intensity.
Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern.
In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw
if it’s inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern,
ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact
action on the pattern. A creature currently blinded by the
pattern doesn’t need to attempt new saving throws.
Success The creature is unaffected.
Failure The creature is blinded by the pattern. If it exits the pattern,
it can attempt a new save to recover from the blinded condition
at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.
Critical Failure The creature is blinded for 1 minute.

CONCENTRATE DEATH EMOTION FEAR MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 living creature

Success The target takes half damage and is frightened 1.
Failure The target takes full damage and is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage, is frightened 4,
and is fleeing for as long as it’s frightened.

VITAL BEACON SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE HEALING MANIPULATE VITALITY
Traditions divine, primal
Cast 1 minute
Duration until your next daily preparations
Vitality radiates outward from you, allowing others to supplicate
and receive healing. Once per round, either you or an ally can
use an Interact action to supplicate and lay hands upon you
to regain Hit Points. Each time the beacon heals someone, it
decreases in strength. It restores 4d10 Hit Points to the first
creature, 4d8 Hit Points to the second, 4d6 Hit Points to the
third, and 4d4 Hit Points to the fourth, after which the spell
ends. You can have only one vital beacon active at a time.
Heightened (+1) The beacon restores one additional die of HP
each time it heals, using the normal die size for that step.
VITALITY LASH [two-actions] CANTRIP 1

Traditions divine, primal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature that is undead or otherwise
has void healing
Defense Fortitude
You demolish the target’s corrupted essence with energy from
Creation’s Forge. You deal 2d6 vitality damage with a basic

VOLCANIC ERUPTION [two-actions] SPELL 7
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE FIRE
Traditions primal
Range 120 feet; Area 5-foot radius, 80-foot-tall cylinder
Defense Reflex
The ground opens up, spraying a column of lava high into the air
in a vertical cylinder, dealing 14d6 fire damage to creatures in the
area. The lava rapidly cools and encases creatures in the area. A
creature encased in rock is clumsy 1 and takes a –10-foot status
penalty to its Speeds. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to a
flying creature, and such creatures immediately descend 20 feet
the moment they’re encased, but they don’t take damage from
this fall. A creature encased in rock can attempt to Escape against
your spell DC to end the effect. Otherwise, the creature remains
encased until it takes a total of 50 damage, freeing it from the rock.
Additionally, creatures in the area and those within 5 feet of
the lava column automatically take 3d6 fire damage from the
intense heat, regardless of the results of their saving throws.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes half damage.
Failure The creature takes full damage and is encased.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and is encased.
Heightened (+1) The damage in the area increases by 2d6, and
the damage from the intense heat increases by 1d6.
WAILS OF THE DAMNED [two-actions] SPELL 9

Failure The creature takes full damage and is drained 1d4.
Critical Failure The creature takes double damage and is drained 4.
WALL OF FIRE [three-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE FIRE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet
Duration 1 minute
You raise a blazing wall that burns creatures passing through it.
You create either a 5-foot-thick wall of flame in a straight line up
to 60 feet long and 10 feet high, or a 5-foot-thick, 10-foot-radius
ring of flame with the same height. The wall stands vertically in
either form; if you wish, the wall can be of a shorter length or
height. Everything on each side of the wall is concealed from
creatures on the opposite side. Any creature that crosses the
wall or is occupying the wall’s area at the start of its turn takes
4d6 fire damage.
Heightened (+1) The fire damage increases by 1d6.
WALL OF FORCE [three-actions] SPELL 6
CONCENTRATE FORCE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 30 feet
Duration 1 minute
You form an invisible wall of pure magical force up to 50
feet long and up to 20 feet high. The wall has no discernible
thickness. You must create the wall in an unbroken open space
so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or objects, or the
spell is lost. The wall has AC 10, Hardness 30, and 60 Hit Points,
and it’s immune to critical hits and precision damage. The wall
blocks physical effects from passing through it, and because it’s
made of force, it blocks incorporeal and ethereal creatures as
well. Teleportation effects can pass through the barrier, as can
visual effects (since the wall is invisible).

Wall of force is immune to effects of its rank or lower that
attempt to counteract it. The wall is automatically destroyed by
a disintegrate spell of any rank.
Heightened (+2) The Hit Points of the wall increases by 20.
WALL OF ICE [three-actions] SPELL 5
COLD CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE WATER
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet
Duration 1 minute
You sculpt an ice barrier that blocks sight and, once shattered,
freezes foes. You create either a 1-foot-thick wall of ice in a
straight line up to 60 feet long and 10 feet high (the wall doesn’t
have to be vertical, but it must be anchored on both sides to
a solid surface) or a 1-foot-thick, 10-foot radius hemisphere of
ice. The ice that makes up the wall is opaque. If you wish, the
wall can be of a smaller length, height, or radius. You must
create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don’t
pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost.
Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness
10, and 40 Hit Points, and it’s immune to critical hits, cold damage,
and precision damage. A section also has weakness to fire 15; a
section of the wall destroyed by fire melts, evaporating into water
and steam. A section destroyed by means other than fire leaves
behind a chilling mass of ice that is difficult terrain and deals 2d6
cold damage to any creature passing through it.
Heightened (+2) The Hit Points of each section of the wall
increase by 10, and the cold damage dealt to creatures
crossing a destroyed section increases by 1d6.
WALL OF STONE [three-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE EARTH MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet
You shape a wall of solid stone. You create a 1-inch-thick wall
of stone up to 120 feet long, and 20 feet high. You can shape
the wall’s path, placing each 5 feet of the wall on the border
between squares. The wall doesn’t need to stand vertically, so
you can use it to form a bridge or set of stairs, for example. You
must conjure the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges
don’t pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost.
Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10,
Hardness 14, and 50 Hit Points, and it’s immune to critical hits
and precision damage. A destroyed section of the wall can be
moved through, but the rubble created from it is difficult terrain.
Heightened (+2) The Hit Points of each section of the wall
increase by 15.
WALL OF THORNS [three-actions] SPELL 3
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE PLANT WOOD
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 60 feet
Duration 1 minute
Over the course of a minute, you grow a wall of thorny brambles
from the ground. You create a 5-foot-thick wall of brambles and
thorns in a straight line up to 60 feet long and 10 feet high. You
must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don’t
pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. The wall
stands vertically. If you wish, the wall can be of a shorter length
or height. Everything on each side of the wall has cover from
creatures on the opposite side, and the wall’s spaces are difficult
terrain. For every move action a creature uses to enter at least
one of the wall’s spaces, that creature takes 3d4 piercing damage.
Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness
10, and 20 Hit Points. It’s immune to critical hits and precision
damage. A destroyed section can be moved through freely.
Heightened (+1) The Hit Points of each section of the wall
increase by 5, and the piercing damage increases by 1d4.
WALL OF WIND [three-actions] SPELL 3
AIR CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 120 feet
Duration 1 minute
You create a barrier of gusting winds that hinders anything
moving through it. The wall of swirling winds is 5 feet thick, 60
feet long, and 30 feet high. The wall stands vertically, but you can
shape its path. Though the wall of wind distorts the air, it does not
hamper sight. The wall has the following effects.
• Ammunition from physical ranged attacks—such as arrows,
bolts, sling bullets, and other objects of similar size—can’t
pass through the wall. Attacks with bigger ranged weapons,

such as javelins, take a –2 circumstance penalty to their
attack rolls if their paths pass through the wall. Massive
ranged weapons and spell effects that don’t create physical
objects pass through the wall with no penalty.
• The wall is difficult terrain to creatures attempting to move
overland through it. Gases, including creatures in vapor
form, can’t pass through the wall.
• A creature that attempts to fly through the wall using a
move action must attempt a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature can move through the wall
normally this turn.
Success The flying creature can move through the wall
this turn, but the wall is difficult terrain.
Failure The wall stops the movement of the flying
creature, and any remaining movement from its current
action is wasted.
Critical Failure As failure, and the creature is pushed 10
feet away from the wall.
WARP MIND [two-actions] SPELL 7
CONCENTRATE EMOTION INCAPACITATION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will
You scramble a creature’s mental faculties and sensory input.
The target must attempt a Will saving throw. Regardless of the
result of that save, the target is then temporarily immune for 10
minutes. Warp mind’s effects happen instantly, so dispel magic
and other effects that counteract spells can’t counteract them.
However, wish rituals and abilities that can remove non-magical
effects can still counteract the effects.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target spends the first action on its next turn with
the confused condition.
Failure The target is confused for 1 minute.
Critical Failure The target is confused permanently.
WATER BREATHING SPELL 2

WATER WALK [two-actions] SPELL 2
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE WATER
Traditions arcane, divine, primal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 10 minutes
The target can walk on the surface of water and other liquids
without falling through. It can go underwater if it wishes, but
in that case it must Swim normally. This spell doesn’t grant the
ability to breathe underwater.
Heightened (4th) The spell’s range increases to 30 feet, the duration
increases to 1 hour, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
WAVE OF DESPAIR [two-actions] SPELL 5
CONCENTRATE EMOTION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions arcane, occult
Area 30-foot cone
Defense Will; Duration 1 or more rounds
You inflict despair on creatures in the area. The effects for each
creature are determined by its Will save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success For 1 round, the creature can’t use reactions and must
attempt another save at the start of its turn; on a failure, it is
slowed 1 for that turn as it sobs uncontrollably.
Failure As success, but the duration is 1 minute.
Critical Failure As failure, and the creature is automatically
slowed 1 for 1 minute.
Heightened (7th) The area increases to a 60-foot cone.
WEAPON STORM [two-actions] SPELL 4
CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE
Traditions arcane, primal
Area 30-foot cone or 10-foot emanation
Defense Reflex
You swing a weapon you’re holding, and the weapon magically
multiplies into duplicates that swipe at all creatures in either

a cone or an emanation. This flurry deals four dice of damage
to creatures in the area. This damage has the same type as the
weapon and uses the same die size. Determine the die size as if
you were attacking with the weapon; for instance, if you were

wielding a two-hand weapon in both hands, you’d use its two-
hand damage die.

Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The target takes half damage.
Failure The target takes full damage.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage and is subject to
the weapon’s critical specialization effect.
Heightened (+1) Add another damage die.
WRATHFUL STORM [three-actions] SPELL 9
AIR COLD CONCENTRATE ELECTRICITY MANIPULATE
Traditions primal
Range 800 feet; Area 400-foot burst
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
A massive storm cloud forms in the air above the area, spreading
rain and gales. The wind imposes a –4 circumstance penalty to
physical ranged attacks. The air in the area is greater difficult
terrain for flying creatures. When you Cast this Spell and the
first time each round you Sustain it on subsequent rounds, you
can choose one of the following storm effects. You can’t choose
the same effect twice in a row.
• Blizzard The driving snow deals 4d8 cold damage to each
creature in or below the storm with no save. Everything in
or beneath the cloud is concealed by driving snow and any
ground is difficult terrain.
• Hail Each creature in or below the storm takes 4d10
bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save.
• Lightning Choose up to 10 creatures in or below the
storm to be struck by lightning. Each of them takes 7d6
electricity damage with a basic Reflex save.
• Tornado A roughly cylindrical whirlwind appears in or
below the cloud in a 30-foot radius. Each creature in the
whirlwind is thrown 40 feet upward.

cloud is a 1,000-foot burst.
ZEALOUS CONVICTION [two-actions] SPELL 6
CONCENTRATE EMOTION MANIPULATE MENTAL
Traditions divine, occult
Range 30 feet; Targets up to 10 willing creatures
Duration 10 minutes
You bypass your targets’ rational minds, instilling them with
unshakable conviction and zeal. The targets each gain 12
temporary Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to Will saves
against mental effects, as their faith overrides the signals from
their own bodies and minds. If you tell a target to do something,
it must comply with your request, though if it would normally
find the task repugnant, it can attempt a Will save at the end
of its turn each round due to the cognitive dissonance. On a
success, it ends the spell’s effects on itself entirely.
Heightened (9th) The temporary Hit Points increase to 18, and
the status bonus to Will saves increases to +3.
FOCUS SPELLS
Some classes gain special spells that they cast using Focus Points instead of spell slots. The
full rules for casting focus spells appear on page 298.
Bard Composition Spells
ALLEGRO [one-action] CANTRIP 7
UNCOMMON BARD CANTRIP COMPOSITION CONCENTRATE EMOTION MENTAL

COUNTER PERFORMANCE [reaction] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON BARD COMPOSITION CONCENTRATE FOCUS FORTUNE MENTAL
Trigger You or an ally within 60 feet rolls a saving throw
against an auditory or visual effect.
Area 60-foot emanation
Your performance protects you and your allies. Roll a
Performance check for a type you know—it must be an
auditory performance if the trigger was auditory or a visual
one for a visual trigger, and this action gains the traits for the
type of performance (page 243). You and allies in the area can
use the better result between your Performance check and the
saving throw.
COURAGEOUS ANTHEM [one-action] CANTRIP 1
UNCOMMON BARD CANTRIP COMPOSITION CONCENTRATE EMOTION MENTAL
Area 60-foot emanation

which they would die.

UNCOMMON BARD CANTRIP COMPOSITION CONCENTRATE EMOTION MENTAL
Muse maestro
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 ally

Your performance makes allies feel they can succeed at
anything. This counts as having prepared to Aid your ally on a
skill check of your choice. When you later use the Aid reaction,
you can roll Performance instead of the normal skill check,
and if you roll a failure, you get a success instead. If you are
legendary in Performance, you automatically critically succeed.

While in a crowd of roughly similar creatures, your appearance
becomes bland and nondescript. You gain a +2 status bonus
to Deception and Stealth checks to go incognito among the

PULSE OF CIVILIZATION [two-actions] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS MANIPULATE SCRYING
Range 25 miles
Duration 8 hours
You tap into the zeitgeist of any settlements in range. You
learn the names of the settlements. On all Lore checks to Recall
Knowledge about those settlements or to Gather Information
in or about those settlements, you gain a +2 status bonus
and use your level as your proficiency bonus even if you’re
untrained. When you Cast the Spell, you can immediately
Recall Knowledge about one of the settlements using its Lore
skill (such as Absalom Lore), which benefits from the bonus. If
you cast pulse of civilization again, any previous casting ends.

Confidence
VEIL OF CONFIDENCE [one-action] FOCUS 1

You surround yourself in confidence. You reduce your current
frightened condition by 1, and whenever you would become
frightened during the duration, reduce the amount by 1. If you
critically fail a save against a fear effect, veil of confidence

DELUSIONAL PRIDE [two-actions] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE EMOTION FOCUS MANIPULATE MENTAL
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration varies
You make the target overconfident, leading it to ascribe
failure to external factors. The target attempts a Will save to
determine the spell’s duration and is temporarily immune for
24 hours regardless of the save’s result.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The duration is 1 round. If the target fails at an attack
roll or skill check, it takes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls

next turn, if it attempted the roll outside its turn). If the
creature fails a second time while taking this penalty, the
penalty increases to –2.

Range 15 feet; Targets 1 item or work of art that fits entirely
within the range
Duration 10 minutes
You transform the target into a form that more closes
matches your creative vision. It’s clearly the same item, but
with aesthetic details you choose. The target is a beautiful
and impressive piece for its new quality, but the effect is
obviously magical and temporary, so its monetary value
doesn’t change. If you’re an expert in Crafting, the item
grants a +1 item bonus to attack rolls if it’s a weapon or skill
checks if it’s a skill tool.
When you Cast this Spell, any previous casting ends.
Heightened (7th) If you’re a master in Crafting, the item grants
a +2 item bonus.
Heightened (10th) If you’re legendary in Crafting, the item
grants a +3 item bonus.
Darkness
CLOAK OF SHADOW [one-action] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON AURA CLERIC DARKNESS FOCUS MANIPULATE SHADOW
Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature
Duration 1 minute
You drape the target in a mantle of swirling shadows that
make it harder to see. The cloak reduces bright light within
a 20-foot emanation to dim light. This is a form of magical
darkness and can therefore overcome non-magical light or
attempt to counteract magical light as described on page 431.
The target can use concealed condition gained from the
shadows to Hide, though observant creatures can still follow
the moving aura of shadow, making it difficult for the target to
become completely undetected. The target can use an Interact
action to remove the cloak and leave it behind as a decoy,
where it remains, reducing light for the rest of the spell’s
duration. If anyone picks up the cloak after it’s been removed
by the original target, the cloak evaporates and the spell ends.

Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature

your choice, though lucidly enough it can wake when it pleases.
If it wakes up before 1 minute of sleep has passed, the spell ends.
• Dream of Insight +1 status bonus to Intelligence-based
skill checks
• Dream of Glamor +1 status bonus to Charisma-based
skill checks
• Dream of Voyaging +5-foot status bonus to Speed
If you Cast this Spell again, any previous sweet dream you
cast ends.

is +3.

UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS ILLUSION INCAPACITATION
MANIPULATE MENTAL
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration until the end of the target’s next turn
You create a vivid, illusory daydream drawn from the images of
the target’s dreams. The daydream appears in an unoccupied
space in range, and you attempt to draw the target toward it.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target’s attention wavers. It becomes fascinated
by the daydream.
Failure The target is fascinated with the daydream and
pursues a course of action you choose as its first action
after you Cast the Spell: approach the daydream, run away
from it (as the fleeing condition), Release what it’s holding
as an offering, or Drop Prone in obeisance.
Critical Failure As failure, but the target follows the course
of action for as many actions as possible for the spell’s
duration, and does nothing else.

push it up to 10 feet.

Each ally decides individually which modifier to use.
Fate
READ FATE [two-actions] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS MANIPULATE PREDICTION
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature other than you
You attempt to learn more about the target’s fate in the short
term, usually within the next day for most prosaic creatures,
or the next hour or less for someone likely to have multiple
rapid experiences, such as someone actively adventuring.
You learn a single enigmatic word connected to the
creature’s fate in that time frame. Fate is notoriously
inscrutable, and the word isn’t necessarily meant to be taken
at face value, so the meaning is often clear only in hindsight.
The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. If the creature’s fate
is too uncertain, or on a failed flat check, the spell yields
the word “inconclusive.” Either way, the creature is then
temporarily immune for 24 hours.
TEMPT FATE [reaction] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CLERIC FOCUS FORTUNE MANIPULATE
Trigger You or an ally within range attempts a saving throw.
Range 120 feet; Targets the triggering creature
You twist the forces of fate to make a moment dire or
uneventful, with no in-between. The target gains a +1 status
bonus to the triggering saving throw. If the saving throw’s
result is a success, it becomes a critical success. If it’s a failure,
it becomes a critical failure, and the critical failure can’t be
reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical failure.
If the triggering ability did not have both a critical success
and critical failure condition, tempt fate fails, but you don’t
expend the Focus Point for Casting this Spell.
Heightened (8th) The bonus on the saving throw is +2.
Fire
FIRE RAY [two-actions] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON ATTACK CLERIC CONCENTRATE FIRE FOCUS MANIPULATE
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense AC
Duration until the end of the target’s next turn
A blazing band of fire arcs through the air, lighting your
opponent and the ground they stand upon on fire. Make a

spell attack roll against the target’s AC. The ray deals 2d6 fire
damage on a hit (or double damage on a critical hit). On any
result other than a critical failure, the ground in the target’s
space catches fire, dealing 1d6 fire damage to each creature
that ends its turn in one of the squares.
Heightened (+1) The ray’s initial damage increases by 2d6, and
the fire damage dealt by the burning space increases by 1d6.
FLAME BARRIER [reaction] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS
Trigger An effect would deal fire damage to you or an ally
within range.
Range 60 feet; Targets one creature that would take fire
damage from the triggering effect
You swiftly deflect incoming flames. The target gains fire
resistance 15 against the triggering effect.
Heightened (+2) The resistance increases by 5.
Freedom
UNIMPEDED STRIDE [one-action] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON CLERIC FOCUS MANIPULATE
Divine grace ensure that nothing can keep you prisoner
or hold you back. You immediately escape from every
magical effect that has you immobilized or grabbed unless
the effect is of a higher rank than your unimpeded stride
spell. You then Stride. During this movement, you ignore
difficult terrain and any circumstance or status penalties
to your Speed.
WORD OF FREEDOM [one-action] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS MENTAL
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration 1 round
You utter a liberating word of power that frees a creature.
You suppress one of the following conditions of your choice:
confused, frightened, grabbed, paralyzed, or restrained.
The target isn’t affected by the chosen condition, and if you
suppress the grabbed or restrained condition, the target
automatically breaks free from the grab or restraint when you
Cast the Spell.
If you don’t remove the effect that provided the condition,
the condition returns after the spell ends. For example, if a
spell was making the target confused for 1 minute, word of
freedom would let the target act normally for a round, but the
confused condition would return afterward.
Healing
HEALER’S BLESSING [one-action] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 willing living creature
Duration 1 minute
Your words bless a creature with an enhanced connection to
vital energy. When the target regains Hit Points from a healing
vitality spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Points.
The target regains additional Hit Points from healer’s
blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given
healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly
over a duration would restore additional Hit Points
only once, when they are first healed.
Heightened (+1) The additional healing increases by 2 HP.
REBUKE DEATH [one-action] TO [three-actions] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CLERIC FOCUS HEALING MANIPULATE VITALITY
Area 20-foot emanation; Targets 1 living creature per action
spent to Cast this Spell
You snatch creatures from the jaws of death, restoring them
without the strain of a typical close call. You can spend 1 to
3 actions Casting this Spell, and you can target a number of
creatures equal to the actions spent. Each target regains 3d6 Hit
Points. If the target had the dying condition, coming back from
dying due to this healing doesn’t increase its wounded condition.
Heightened (+1) Increase the healing by 1d6.
Indulgence
OVERSTUFF [two-actions] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS MANIPULATE
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 living creature
Defense Fortitude
Huge amounts of food and drink fill the target. It receives a

save. A target sickened by this spell takes a –10-foot status
penalty to its Speed until it’s no longer sickened.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target is sickened 1, but if it spends an action to
end the condition, it succeeds automatically.

Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will
When someone has overindulged, you can hasten them past
the worst of their affliction or intensify their misery. This spell
attempts to progress a disease affliction, a poison affliction, or
persistent poison damage affecting the target. If the target is
affected by more than one of these, choose from among those
you are aware of; otherwise, the GM chooses randomly. An
unwilling target can attempt a Will save to negate take its course.
The effect of this spell depends on whether you’re attempting
to end an affliction or persistent poison damage, and whether
you are attempting to help or hinder the target’s recovery.
• Affliction The target immediately attempts its next saving
throw against the affliction. You can grant the creature
your choice of a +2 status bonus or a –2 status penalty to
its saving throw against the affliction.
• Persistent Poison You can cause the target to take the
persistent poison damage immediately when you Cast this
Spell (in addition to taking it at the end of its next turn).

Whether or not you do so, the target attempts an additional
flat check against the persistent poison damage. You can set
the DC of that flat check to 5 or 20 instead of the normal DC.
Heightened (7th) You can attempt to progress any number of
the target’s eligible afflictions and persistent poison damage.

disaster. When the target would attempt a saving throw, it can roll
twice and use the better result. Once it does this, the spell ends.

that’s still in effect ends. After a creature has been targeted
with bit of luck, it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.

as if the spell were heightened 1 rank higher than its actual
rank. This applies only to initial healing or damage when the

something harmless instead of charming touch, unless it
identifies the spell (see Identifying Spells on page 303).

actions against you. If you use a hostile action against the

charmed unless its friendship with you or the actions you
convinced it to take clash with its expectations. If it doesn’t

You become intensely entrancing, and creatures are distracted
by you as long as they remain within the area. You can exclude
any creatures you choose from the effects. If a creature is in
the aura when you Cast the Spell or when it enters the aura for

You meditate upon perfection to remove all distractions from
your mind. Attempt a new Will save against one mental effect
currently affecting you that required a Will save. Use the
result of this new save to determine the outcome of the mental
effect, unless the new save would have a worse result than
the original save, in which case nothing happens. You can use
perfected mind against a given effect only once.
PERFECTED BODY [reaction] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS
Trigger You fail or critically fail a saving throw against an
effect that has the morph, poison, or polymorph trait, or
that would make you clumsy, doomed, enfeebled, petrified,

than most. You get a failure if you rolled a critical failure or a
success if you rolled a failure.
Protection
PROTECTOR’S SACRIFICE [reaction] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON CLERIC FOCUS MANIPULATE
Trigger An ally within 30 feet takes damage.
Range 30 feet
You protect your ally by suffering in their stead. Reduce the
damage the ally would take by 3. You redirect this damage to
yourself, but your immunities, weaknesses, resistances and so
on do not apply.
You aren’t subject to any conditions or other effects of
whatever damaged your ally (such as poison from a venomous
bite). Your ally is still subject to those effects even if you
redirect all of the triggering damage to yourself.
Heightened (+1) The damage you redirect increases by 3.

UNCOMMON CLERIC FOCUS MANIPULATE SONIC
Range 60 feet; Area 15-foot burst
Duration 1 minute
You suppress sound in an area, preventing anyone from giving
away valuable secrets. This doesn’t prevent those in the area
from talking or Casting a Spell, but no creature more than 5
feet away can hear its voice without succeeding at a Perception
check against your spell DC, which might interfere with auditory
or linguistic effects as well as communication. Other sounds
created in the area are muffled to a similar volume unless that
sound is created by an effect with the sonic trait.
SAFEGUARD SECRET [two-actions] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS MANIPULATE MENTAL
Range 30 feet; Targets you and any number of willing allies
Duration 1 hour
You ensure a secret remains safe from prying spies. Choose
one piece of information that at least some of the targets know,
such as “the location of the stolen treasure” or “the password
to enter the guild house.” The spell grants those who know the
piece of knowledge you have chosen a +4 status bonus to skill
checks (typically Deception checks) to conceal this knowledge,
to saving throws against spells that specifically attempt to
obtain this knowledge from them, and to effects that would
force them to reveal it.
If you Cast this Spell again, any previous safeguard secret
you had cast ends.

Duration 1 minute
Drawing life force into yourself, you become a beacon of vitality.
You glow with bright light in a 30-foot emanation (and dim light
to the next 30 feet), and you gain an internal pool of light called
a luminance reservoir, which begins with a value of 4. At the
start of each of your turns, increase your reservoir by 4.
If an undead creature damages you with an attack or spell
while it’s within the bright light of your aura, that creature takes
vitality damage equal to half your luminance reservoir value. It
takes this damage only the first time it damages you in a round.
You can Dismiss this Spell. When you do, you can target a
creature within your light and direct the vitality energy into
it. The target must be a willing living creature or an undead
creature. This heals a living target or deals vitality damage to
an undead target equal to your luminance reservoir’s value.
If you Cast this Spell again, any previous casting ends.
Heightened (+1) Both the initial value of your luminance
reservoir and the amount it increases each turn increase by 1.
Travel
AGILE FEET [one-action] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON CLERIC FOCUS MANIPULATE
Duration until the end of the current turn
The blessings of your god make your feet faster and your
movements more fluid. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to
your Speed and ignore difficult terrain. As part of casting agile
feet, you can Step, Stride, or Tumble Through; you can instead
Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim if you have the appropriate Speed.
TRAVELER’S TRANSIT [two-actions] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS MANIPULATE

You swiftly move from a dangerous spot and veil yourself. You
Step and become concealed.
TRICKSTER’S TWIN [two-actions] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS ILLUSION MANIPULATE VISUAL
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense Will; Duration 1 minute
You rarely settle for being in just one place. Choose a location
within 100 feet of the target that the target can see. You
create an illusion of yourself there that only it can see and that
mimics all your actions. The target must attempt a Will save.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target believes you’re in the designated location
and can’t see you in your actual location. The target
automatically disbelieves the illusion when you use an
action that doesn’t make sense in the illusion’s position, or
if the target attacks, touches, Seeks, or otherwise engages
with the illusion. If you use a hostile action against the
target, the spell ends.
Failure As success, but the target must succeed at a Will
save to disbelieve the illusion when one of the listed
events occurs.
Critical Failure As success, but the target must critically
succeed at a Will save to disbelieve when one of the listed
events occurs.
Truth
WORD OF TRUTH [one-action] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You speak a statement that you believe to be true and that
is free of any attempt to deceive through twisting words,
omission, and so on. The statement must be 25 words or
fewer. A symbol of your deity glows above your head and
lasts for the spell’s duration, and anyone who sees you and
hears you speak knows instinctively that you believe what
you say is true. This assurance of honesty grants you a +2
status bonus to Diplomacy checks as long as the symbol
persists. You can Dismiss the spell, and if you say something
that you don’t believe is entirely true, the spell ends before
you complete your statement.
GLIMPSE THE TRUTH [one-action] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON AURA CLERIC FOCUS MANIPULATE REVELATION
Area 30-foot emanation
Duration 1 round
Divine insight lets you see things as they are, unveiled by
attempts to magically cloak the truth. The GM attempts a
secret counteract check against each illusion that is at least
partially within the area. Instead of counteracting the illusion,
you see through it (for instance, if the check succeeds against
an illusory disguise spell, you see the creature’s true form
but illusory disguise doesn’t end). Each time a new illusion
comes into the aura during the duration of the spell, the GM
attempts a secret counteract check for that illusion.
Heightened (7th) You can allow everyone within range of the
emanation to see through any illusions you succeed against,
not just yourself.

UNCOMMON CLERIC FOCUS MANIPULATE MENTAL

next turn.

Range 100 feet; Targets a creature you dealt damage to on
your most recent action
Defense Will; Duration until the end of the target’s next turn
With the threat of more pain, you compel a creature you’ve
recently harmed. You issue a command to the target, with
the effects of the spell command. If the target is frightened,
stupefied, or taking persistent damage, it takes a –2
circumstance penalty to the save. Regardless of the result, the
target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.
Undeath
TOUCH OF UNDEATH [one-action] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON CLERIC FOCUS MANIPULATE VOID

TIDAL SURGE [one-action] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON CLERIC FOCUS MANIPULATE WATER
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature
You call forth a tremendous wave to move the target either in
a body of water or on the ground. You move the target up to
10 feet in any direction along the ground or 20 feet through
a body of water. An unwilling target can attempt a Fortitude
save, and it avoids being moved if it succeeds.
DOWNPOUR [two-actions] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS MANIPULATE WATER
Range 120 feet; Area 30-foot burst
Duration 1 minute

You call forth a torrential downpour, which extinguishes non-
magical flames. Creatures in the area are concealed and gain fire

resistance 10. Creatures outside the area are concealed to those
inside the area. If a creature with weakness to water ends its
turn in the area, the downpour triggers its weakness.
Heightened (+1) The fire resistance increases by 2.
Wealth
APPEARANCE OF WEALTH [two-actions] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON CLERIC CONCENTRATE FOCUS ILLUSION MANIPULATE
Range 30 feet; Area 5-foot burst
Defense Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You create a brief vision of immense wealth filling the spell’s area.
Each creature within 20 feet of the area that could be enticed
by material wealth must attempt a Will saving throw. A creature
that enters the area automatically disbelieves the illusion, and
disbelieving the illusion ends any fascinated condition imposed
by the spell. As long as you Sustain the spell, other creatures
react to the treasure like they would any other illusion, but they
are not at risk of becoming fascinated.
Critical Success The creature disbelieves the illusion and is
unaffected by it.
Success The creature is fascinated by the wealth until it has
completed its first action on its next turn.
Failure The creature is fascinated by the illusion.
PRECIOUS METALS [one-action] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CLERIC FOCUS MANIPULATE METAL
Range touch; Targets 1 metal shield or weapon, 1 suit of metal
armor, or up to 1 Bulk of metal material (such as coins or
metal-tipped ammunition)
Duration 1 minute
Your deity blesses base metals to transform them into precious
materials. The metal in the target transforms from its normal
metal into cold iron, copper, gold, iron, silver, or steel. If the
spell’s rank is 8th or higher, add adamantine and dawnsilver
to the options. If you transform an object into copper, gold,
or silver, its Hardness is reduced to 1. Otherwise, its Hardness
is increased to 10 if it was lower. An item transmuted in this
way deals damage according to its new material. For example,

a steel sword transmuted to cold iron would deal additional
damage to a creature with a weakness to cold iron. It can have
other effects of the new material at the GM’s discretion.
This change is clearly magical and temporary, so the item’s
monetary value doesn’t change; you couldn’t transmute copper
coins to gold and use them to purchase something.
Heightened (+1) If you increase the Hardness of the object, the
new Hardness is 2 higher.
Zeal
WEAPON SURGE [one-action] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON CLERIC FOCUS MANIPULATE SANCTIFIED

sanctified trait. Weapon surge ends once you complete this
Strike or the weapon leaves your possession.

eats the produce with an Interact action regains 1d6+4 HP. The
cornucopia, as well as any unconsumed pieces of fruit, wither
away at the end of the duration.
Heightened (+1) The cornucopia produces an additional piece of
food. A creature can consume any amount of food from the
same casting with a single Interact action. Eating six pieces
of produce from the cornucopia gives as much nourishment
as one square meal for a typical human.

Area ground within a 100-foot emanation
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
The ground within the area transforms into a mass of dangerous
briars that assault and impede your foes. When you Cast the
Spell and the first time you Sustain it each turn on subsequent
rounds, select one of the following effects to occur in the area.
• Ensnare The briars clump around your foes, attempting to
hold them in place. A foe within the area (or flying at most

a failure, it takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to all

In addition, once per round you can direct the briars to impale
any target in the area (or flying up to 20 feet above the area)
that you can see by using a single action, which has the

that you can follow just as you would on land. You can use
Survival to Track through both air and water, noticing aerial
or aquatic “tracks” of all creatures who passed nearby in the

Track through air or water is always at least 30, or higher after
precipitation or wind (in the air) or heavy tides or currents (in

those who follow your lead. Your target is visible to you and
others sharing your Hunt Prey benefits even if it wouldn’t
normally be due to lighting or the concealed or invisible
conditions, though cover from opaque objects still blocks your
sight. You ignore the flat check against the target due to the

Unified Magical Theory
HAND OF THE APPRENTICE [one-action] FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON ATTACK FOCUS MANIPULATE WIZARD
Range 500 feet; Targets 1 creature
Defense AC
You take advantage of one of the most fundamental lessons
of magic to levitate and propel your weapon. You hurl a held
melee weapon with which you are trained at the target, making
a spell attack roll. On a success, you deal the weapon’s damage
as if you had hit with a melee Strike, but add your spellcasting
attribute modifier to damage, rather than your Strength
modifier. On a critical success, you deal double damage, and
you add the weapon’s critical specialization effect. Regardless
of the outcome, the weapon flies back to you and returns to
your hand.
INTERDISCIPLINARY INCANTATION [reaction] FOCUS 4
UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE FOCUS WIZARD
Trigger A creature within 30 feet casts an arcane spell.
You gather the embers of another caster’s spell, using your
understanding of unified magic to pick apart their formulas
and incantations well enough to imitate the spell yourself,
if only for a short time. Until the end of your next turn, you
can Cast the triggering Spell by expending a wizard spell
slot of the same rank. That caster’s spells can’t trigger your
interdisciplinary incantation again for 24 hours.
RITUALS
A ritual is an esoteric and complex spell that anyone can cast. It takes much longer to cast
a ritual than a normal spell, but rituals can have more powerful effects.
Casting Rituals
When you take charge of a ritual, you are its primary
caster, and others assisting you are secondary casters.
You can be a primary caster for a ritual even if you can’t
cast spells. You must know the ritual, and the ritual’s
spell rank can be no higher than half your level rounded
up. You must also have the required proficiency rank in
the skill used for the ritual’s primary check (see Checks
below), and as the primary caster, you must attempt this
skill check to determine the ritual’s effects. The primary
skill check determines the tradition.
Rituals do not require spell slots to cast. You can
heighten a ritual up to half your level rounded up, decided
when the ritual is initiated. A ritual always takes at least
1 hour to perform, and often longer. While a ritual is a
downtime activity, it’s possible—albeit risky—to perform
a ritual during exploration with enough uninterrupted
time. A ritual’s casting time is usually listed in days. Each
day of casting requires 8 hours of participation in the
ritual from all casters, with breaks during multiday rituals
to allow rest. One caster can continue a multiday ritual,
usually with some light chanting or meditation, while the
other casters rest. All rituals require repeated spellcasting
words and gestures throughout their casting time.

Learning Rituals
Learning a ritual does not count against any limits on
spells in your spell repertoire or on any other normal

spellcasting ability. Rituals are never common, though if
you look hard, you can probably find someone who can
perform an uncommon ritual for you. They may still be
unwilling to teach it to you.
Cost
A ritual’s Cost entry lists valuable components required to
cast the ritual. If a ritual doesn’t have any such components,
it won’t have a Cost entry. The cost is consumed when you
attempt the primary skill check. Costs are often presented
as a base cost multiplied by the target’s level and sometimes
the spell’s rank. If the target’s level is lower than 1, multiply
the cost by 1 instead. Heightened versions that increase the
base cost multiply it by the target’s level or another value as
appropriate. Most rituals that create permanent creatures,
such as create undead, use costs based on the level of the
creature, as presented on Creature Creations Ritual Table
on page 390.
Secondary Casters
Many rituals need additional secondary casters, who
also don’t need to be able to cast spells. Unlike a primary
caster, a secondary caster doesn’t need a minimum level
or skill proficiency. The Secondary Casters entry, if
present, indicates the minimum number of secondary
casters required.
Checks
At the ritual’s culmination, you must attempt the skill
check listed in the Primary Check entry to determine the
ritual’s outcome. Primary checks usually have a very hard
DC for a level that’s twice the ritual’s spell rank. As with
other downtime activities, fortune and misfortune effects
can’t modify your checks for the ritual, nor can bonuses
or penalties that aren’t active throughout the process.
The GM can adjust the DCs of rituals, add or change
primary or secondary checks, or even waive requirements
to fit specific circumstances. For example, performing a
ritual in a location where ley lines converge on the night
of a new moon might make a normally difficult ritual
drastically easier.
Secondary Checks
Often, a ritual requires secondary checks to represent aspects
of its casting, usually with a standard DC for a level twice
the ritual’s spell rank. A different secondary caster must
attempt each secondary check. If there are more secondary
casters than checks, the others don’t attempt any.
Secondary casters attempt their checks before you
attempt the primary check; no matter their results, the
ritual proceeds to the primary check. Secondary checks
affect the primary check depending on their results.
Critical Success You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the
primary check.
Success No bonus or penalty.
Failure You take a –4 circumstance penalty to the primary check.
Critical Failure As failure, and you reduce the degree of success
of the primary skill check by one step.
Effect
A ritual’s effect depends on the result of the primary check.
If an effect lists a save DC, use your spell DC for the ritual’s
magic tradition (or 12 + your level + your highest mental
attribute modifier, if you don’t have a spell DC).
Rituals
ANIMATE OBJECT RITUAL 2
UNCOMMON
Cast 1 day; Cost rare oils, see Creature Creation Rituals (page
390); Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Arcana (expert); Secondary Checks Crafting
Range 10 feet; Target 1 object
You transform the target into an animated object with a level
up to that allowed by the Creature Creation Rituals table
and of a type corresponding to the object (so a broom would
become an animated broom).
Critical Success The target becomes an animated object of the
appropriate type. If it’s at least 4 levels lower than you, you
can make it a minion. This gives it the minion trait, meaning it
can use 2 actions when you command it, and commanding it
is a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits.
You can have a maximum of four minions under your control.
If it doesn’t become a minion, you can give it one simple
command. It pursues that goal single-mindedly, ignoring any
of your subsequent commands.
Success As critical success, except an animated object that
doesn’t become your minion stays in place and attacks
anyone that attacks it or tries to steal or move it, rather than
following your command.
Failure You fail to create the animated object.
Critical Failure You create the animated object, but it goes
berserk and attempts to destroy you.

ATONE RITUAL 4
UNCOMMON
Cast 1 day; Cost rare incense and offerings worth a total value of
20 gp × the target’s level; Secondary Casters 1, must be the
ritual’s target
Primary Check Nature or Religion (expert); Secondary Checks
Nature or Religion (whichever is used for the primary check)
Range 10 feet; Targets another creature of up to 8th level who is
a worshipper of the same deity or philosophy as you
You attempt to help a truly penitent creature atone for its
misdeeds, typically actions that are anathema to your deity.
If the creature isn’t truly penitent, the outcome is always a
critical failure. This ritual uses Nature if the target is a druid,
and Religion in all other cases.
Critical Success The creature receives absolution for its
misdeeds, allowing it to regain standing with your deity.
It regains any abilities it lost. Before the atonement is
complete, the creature must perform a special quest or
other task chosen by your deity, as befits its misdeeds. If
completed during downtime, this task should take no less
than 1 month. For 1 month, the target receives divine insight
just before performing an act that would be anathema to
your deity.
Success As critical success, but the creature gains no special
insight regarding its subsequent actions.
Failure The creature does not receive absolution and must
continue to meditate and redress its misdeeds. Any
future atone rituals for the same misdeeds cost half as
much and gain a +4 circumstance bonus to primary and
secondary checks.
Critical Failure The creature offends your deity and is
permanently cast out from the faith. The creature can’t rejoin
your religion without a more direct intervention.
Heightened (+1) Increase the maximum target level by 2 and the
base cost by 20 gp.
AWAKEN ANIMAL RITUAL 6
UNCOMMON MENTAL
Cast 1 day; Cost herbs, 1/5 the value on Creature Creation Rituals
(page 390); Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Nature (master); Secondary Checks Lore (any),
Society, Survival
Range 10 feet; Target 1 animal of up to the level on the table
You grant intelligence to the target, transforming it into a beast.
If it was previously an animal companion or minion, it can no
longer serve as one.
Critical Success The target’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma modifiers each increase to +2 if they were lower,
and it becomes helpful to you for awakening it.
Success The target’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
modifiers increase to +0 if they were lower and it becomes
friendly to you for awakening it.
Failure You fail to awaken the target.
Critical Failure You accidentally awaken the target with a pure
bestial hatred toward you. The target’s Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma modifiers increase to –2 if they were lower. It
becomes hostile to you, attempting to destroy you.
BINDING CIRCLE RITUAL 6
UNCOMMON
Cast 1 day; Cost warding circle ingredients worth a total value of
2 gp × the spell rank × the target’s level; Secondary Casters 3
Primary Check Arcana (master) or Occultism (master);
Secondary Checks Diplomacy or Intimidation; Arcana or
Occultism (whichever isn’t used for the primary check)
Range interplanar; Targets 1 extraplanar creature
Duration varies
You call forth an extraplanar creature of a level no greater than
double that of the binding circle ritual’s rank and attempt to
bargain with it, generally to perform a task for you in exchange
for payment.
You conjure the extraplanar creature within your circle and
negotiate a deal with it. A creature that doesn’t wish to negotiate
at all can attempt a Will save to stay on its home plane. Most
extraplanar creatures feel that they have something better to do
than cater to the whims of mortals and require a significant gift,
especially if your task poses major risks. Fiends and similarly
wicked extraplanar creatures are more likely to accept a bargain
for a lower cost as long as it allows them to wreak havoc on the
Universe or inflict evil upon the world along the way.
Monetary prices usually range from the cost of a consumable
item of the creature’s level for a short and simple task to a
permanent magic item of the creature’s level or more to persuade
the creature to fight alongside you. However, some extraplanar
creatures may want payments other than money, such as
permission to cast a geas on you to fulfill an unspecified later
favor or obtain ownership of your soul via an infernal contract.
You can add an additional secondary caster to create a
warding circle that prevents the extraplanar creature from
attacking or leaving the circle during the bargain. This uses
the Crafting skill and has the same DC as a secondary check
would. This protection ends if you use a hostile action against
the extraplanar creature or the warding circle breaks.
Critical Success You call the extraplanar creature and can
prevent it from returning home for up to a full day, potentially
allowing you to negotiate a better deal by threatening to
leave it in the wards for the duration.
Success You call the extraplanar creature and must make your
case succinctly, after which the creature can return home at
any time.
Failure You fail to call the extraplanar creature.
Critical Failure You call something vile and horrible, unbound
by your wards, and it immediately attempts to destroy you.

BLIGHT RITUAL 4
UNCOMMON PLANT VOID
Cast 1 day; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Nature (expert); Secondary Checks Survival
Area 1/2-mile-radius circle centered on you
Duration 1 year
You twist and stunt plants in the area, causing them to wither. In
addition to other dangers from failing plant life, this decreases
the crop yield for farms. If you cast this ritual in an area affected
by plant growth, blight attempts to counteract plant growth
instead of producing its usual effect.
Critical Success Completely spoil the crop yield in the area, or
decrease the yield by half in an area with up to a 1-mile radius.
Success Decease the crop yield in the area by half.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure The flora in the area changes in an unexpected
way, determined by the GM but generally as contradictory
to your true desires as possible (for instance, enriching crops
when you would prefer to blight them).
CALL SPIRIT RITUAL 5
UNCOMMON SPIRIT
Cast 1 hour; Cost rare candles and incense worth a total value of
50 gp; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Occultism (expert) or Religion (expert);
Secondary Checks Occultism or Religion (whichever isn’t
used for the primary check)
Duration up to 10 minutes
You tear the veil to the afterlife and call a spirit from its final
resting place. You must call the spirit by name, and you must
provide a connection to the spirit, such as a possession, a
garment, or a piece of its corpse. A spirit unwilling to heed your
call can attempt a Will save to avoid it; on a critical success, a
trickster spirit Impersonates the spirit you meant to call. The DC
of the Will save is 2 lower if you haven’t met the spirit in life.
Either way, the spirit appears as a wispy form of the creature
you meant to call. Each minute of the duration, you can ask the
spirit a question. It can answer how it pleases or even refuse to
answer. If the spirit isn’t in the afterlife (such as if it’s an undead),
all results other than critical failures use the failure effect.
Critical Success The spirit is particularly cooperative, and
even if it has strong reasons to deceive you, it takes a –2
circumstance penalty to its Deception checks.
Success You call the spirit.
Failure You fail to call a spirit.
Critical Failure One or more evil spirits appear and attack.
COLLECTIVE MEMORIES RITUAL 7
UNCOMMON
Cast 1 day; Cost rare incense worth a total value of 300 gp;
Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Occultism (master); Secondary Checks
Performance, Society
You tap into other mortals’ memories, knowledge, legends, tales,
and lore about a subject. The subject must be an important
person, place, or thing. If the subject is present, increase the
degree of success of your primary skill check by one step. If
you have only vague information about the subject before
attempting the ritual, decrease the degree of success of your
primary skill check by one step. These modifiers cancel each
other out if you have a subject present with little to no baseline
information.
Critical Success For 1 hour after the ritual ends, you sort
through memories that are mostly coherent, emphasizing
more accurate or useful information over misremembered
knowledge or exaggerated tales.
Success For 1 hour after the ritual ends, you learn useful
information for further inquiry that remains generally
incomplete or enigmatic. As is the nature of mortal memory
and stories, you are likely to learn multiple contradictory
versions.
Failure You fail to learn any useful legends.
Critical Failure Your mind becomes overwhelmed with the
vast array of knowledge at your disposal. You can’t sense
or respond to anything in the present for 1 week except to
perform necessities like breathing and sleeping. When you
recover, however, you can retrain one of your skills into a Lore
based on the knowledge of a subject you were accessing, as if
you had spent 1 week retraining.
COMMUNE RITUAL 6
UNCOMMON PREDICTION
Cast 1 day; Cost rare incense worth a total value of 150 gp;
Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Nature (master), Occultism (master), or Religion
(master); Secondary Checks Nature, Occultism, or Religion
(whichever is used for the primary check)
Duration up to 10 minutes
You call upon an unknown, powerful being to answer questions.
The being varies depending on the skill used for the primary
check.
• Nature Primal spirits of nature, which know about animals,
beasts, fey, fungi, plants, topography, and natural resources
within a 3-mile radius.
• Occultism Planar and other mysterious entities such as
elementals, forgotten spirits, and monitors, which know
about forgotten knowledge, the planes, obscure secrets,
and other esoterica.
• Religion Divine beings like celestials and fiends that
know about the gods they serve and the god’s respective
purview; these are typically a servitor of your deity if you
have one.
You can ask up to seven questions that could be answered
with “Yes” or “No.” The entity answers with one-word answers
such as “Yes,” “No,” “Likely,” and “Unknown,” though its answers
always reflect its own agenda and could be deceptive.
Critical Success You contact a more powerful entity aligned
strongly with your interests, possibly even your deity. The
entity won’t attempt to deceive you, though it still might not
know the answers. When it’s important to provide clarity, the
entity will answer your questions with up to five words, such
as “If you leave immediately” or “That was true once.”

Success You can ask your questions and receive answers.
Failure You fail to contact an appropriate being.
Critical Failure You are exposed to the enormity of the cosmos
and are stupefied 4 for 1 week (can’t remove by any means).
CONSECRATE RITUAL 2
UNCOMMON CONSECRATION
Cast 3 days; Cost rare incense and offerings worth a total value
of 20 gp × the spell rank; Secondary Casters 2, must be
worshippers of your religion
Primary Check Religion; Secondary Checks Crafting,
Performance
Range 40 feet; Area 40-foot-radius burst around an immobile
altar, shrine, or fixture of your deity
Duration 1 year
You consecrate a site to your deity, chanting praises and creating
a sacred space. While within the area, worshippers of your
deity gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, saving
throws, and Perception checks, and creatures anathema to
your deity (such as undead for Pharasma or Sarenrae) take a –1
status penalty to those rolls. If your deity’s divine sanctification
allows you to choose holy or unholy, you can choose to make
the consecrated site holy or unholy as well. If the deity’s
sanctification must be holy or unholy, you must make the site
match that sanctification. Strikes made by worshippers of your
deity within the area gain the site’s sanctification trait, if any.
Critical Success The consecration succeeds, and it either lasts
for 10 years instead of 1 or covers an area with twice the
radius. Occasionally, with your deity’s favor, this might
produce an even more amazing effect, such as a permanently
consecrated area or the effect covering an entire cathedral.
Success The consecration succeeds.
Failure The consecration fails.
Critical Failure The consecration fails spectacularly and angers
your deity, who sends a sign of displeasure. For at least 1 year,
further attempts to consecrate the site fail.
Heightened (7th) The consecrated area also gains the effects
of the planar seal spell, but the effect doesn’t attempt to
counteract teleportation by worshippers of your deity. The
cost increases to 200 gp × the spell rank.
CONTROL WEATHER RITUAL 8
UNCOMMON
Cast 1 day; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Nature (master); Secondary Checks Survival
Area 2-mile-radius circle centered on you
Duration 4d12 hours
You alter the weather, making it calm and normal for the season
or choosing up to two effects based on the season.
• Spring drizzle, heat, hurricane, sleet, thunderstorm,
tornado
• Summer drizzle, downpour, extreme heat, hail, heat
• Autumn cold weather, fog, mild heat, sleet
• Winter blizzard, mild cold, extreme cold, thaw
You can’t specifically control the manifestations, such as the
exact path of a tornado or the targets of lightning strikes.
Critical Success You change the weather as desired and can
affect a larger area (up to a 5-mile-radius circle), or a longer
duration (any number of additional d12 hours, up to 16d12).
Success You change the weather as desired.
Failure You fail to change the weather as desired.
Critical Failure The weather changes in an unanticipated way,
determined by the GM but generally as contradictory to
your true desires as possible (for instance, a terrible storm
emerges when you would prefer good weather).
Heightened (9th) You can create unseasonable weather and
contradictory weather effects, such as extreme cold and
a hurricane. You can make the weather calm and normal
weather for a different season or choose weather effects
from any season’s list.
CREATE UNDEAD RITUAL 2
UNCOMMON UNHOLY
Cast 1 day; Cost black onyx, see Creature Creation Rituals (page
390); Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Arcana (expert), Occultism (expert), or Religion
(expert); Secondary Checks Religion
Range 10 feet; Target 1 dead creature
You transform the target into an undead creature with a level
up to that allowed in the Creature Creation Rituals table. There
are many versions of this ritual, each specific to a particular
type of undead (one ritual for all zombies, one for skeletons, one
for ghouls, and so on), and the rituals that create rare undead
are also rare. Some forms of undead, such as liches, form using
their own unique methods and can’t be created with a version
of create undead.
Critical Success The target becomes an undead creature of the
appropriate type. If it’s at least 4 levels lower than you, you
can make it a minion. This gives it the minion trait, meaning it
can use 2 actions when you command it, and commanding it
is a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits.
You can have a maximum of four minions under your control.
If it’s intelligent and doesn’t become a minion, the undead is
helpful to you for awakening it, though it’s still a horrid and
evil creature. If it’s unintelligent and doesn’t become a minion,
you can give it one simple command. It pursues that goal
single-mindedly, ignoring any of your subsequent commands.
Success As critical success, except an intelligent undead that
doesn’t become your minion is only friendly to you, and an
unintelligent undead that doesn’t become your minion leaves
you alone unless you attack it. It marauds the local area
rather than following your command.
Failure You fail to create the undead.
Critical Failure You create the undead, but its soul, tortured by
your foul necromancy, is full of nothing but hatred for you. It
attempts to destroy you.
GEAS RITUAL 3
UNCOMMON CURSE MENTAL
Cast 1 day; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Arcana (expert), Occultism (expert), or Religion
(expert); Secondary Checks Society or Legal Lore

Range 10 feet; Targets 1 creature of a level no greater than
double the geas ritual’s rank
Duration see text
You enforce a magic rule on a willing target, forcing it to either
perform or refrain from carrying out a certain act. A geas to
perform an act is usually conditional, such as, “Always offer
hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay.” An unconditional
geas to perform a certain act doesn’t require the target to perform
that act exclusively, though it must prioritize the task above
all leisurely pursuits. The most common geas to refrain from
carrying out an act is a specification to avoid violating a contract.
In those cases, the secondary caster usually takes charge of
making sure the wording of the contract is attuned correctly
with the ritual’s magic. Because the target is willing, geas can
have a duration that lasts for as long as the target agrees to. If
the target is unable to fulfill the geas, it becomes sickened 1, and
the sickened condition increases by 1 for each consecutive day it
is prevented from following the geas, to a maximum of sickened
4. The sickened condition ends immediately when it follows the
geas again; it can’t remove the sickened condition in any other
way. Only powerful magic such as a wish ritual can remove the
effects of geas from a willing target.
Critical Success The geas succeeds, and the target receives a +1
status bonus to skill checks that directly uphold the geas (at
the GM’s discretion).
Success The geas succeeds.
Failure The geas fails.
Critical Failure The geas fails, and you are instead affected
by the geas you were attempting to place on the target.
You are considered an unwilling target, so the geas can be
counteracted with a cleanse affliction spell.
Heightened (5th) You can use geas on an unwilling creature;
it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. If the target
fails this Will save, the geas lasts up to 1 week. A cleanse
affliction spell can counteract a geas on an unwilling creature,
in addition to powerful magic such as a wish ritual. A clever
unwilling creature can subvert the geas by contriving
situations that prevent it from complying, but in that case it
becomes sickened (as described above).
Heightened (7th) As 5th rank, but the geas lasts for up to 1 year
on an unwilling creature.
Heightened (9th) As 5th rank, but the geas lasts for a duration
you choose (even unlimited) on an unwilling creature.
PLANAR DISPLACEMENT RITUAL 7
UNCOMMON TELEPORTATION
Cast 1 day; Requirements planar key for the destination plane
used as a locus; Cost rare incense, precious metals, and
purified chalk worth 500 gp; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana (master), Nature (master), Occultism
(master), or Religion (master); Secondary Checks Lore (related
to the destination plane), Survival
Range 20 feet; Area 20-foot burst
You draw a ritual circle, and when the ritual is complete, you
shift all creatures in the area to a different plane of existence.
The skill you use for the primary check must be one that can
be used to make a Recall Knowledge check about the intended
destination, such as Arcana or Nature for the Plane of Fire or
Occultism for the Astral Plane.
A secondary caster can be located at the exact site of the
destination, instead of with you at the point of origin. If a
secondary caster at the destination succeeds at its check and
you roll a success, the ritual is a critical success instead.
Critical Success You arrive on the intended plane at the last
place one of the targets (of your choice) was located the last
time the target traveled to that plane. If it’s the first time
traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a
random location on the plane. The circle remains active for 1
minute, during which time any creature the ritual transported
can return to the origin point with a single action, which has
the concentrate trait.
Success As critical success, but you arrive 1d10×25 miles from
your destination.
Failure Your attempt is unsuccessful.
Critical Failure The ritual fails, and the GM determines whether
you travel to the wrong plane or are barred from planar travel
for 1 week.
PLANAR SERVITOR RITUAL 5
UNCOMMON
Cast 1 day; Cost rare incense and offerings worth a total value
of 2 gp × the spell rank × the target’s level, see text for more
details; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Religion (expert); Secondary Checks Diplomacy
Duration see text
You call upon a deity (or other divine power) to grant you aid in
the form of a divine servitor of your deity’s choice, with a level
no greater than double the ritual’s spell rank. The secondary
casters explain what sort of assistance you need and why you
need it; if the task is incredibly fitting to the deity, the GM can
grant a circumstance bonus to the secondary Diplomacy check
or rule that the check is automatically a critical success. If you
use the ritual without good reason, the result is automatically a
critical failure.
If the ritual succeeds, you must offer the servitor payment
depending on factors such as the duration and danger of the
task. Payment always costs at least as much as a consumable
item of the creature’s level, and often costs as much as a
permanent magic item of the creature’s level to persuade a
creature to fight alongside you. Your offerings should align with
the personal tastes of the deity.
You can alternatively name a being native to the deity’s realm
that you know personally, with the same level restriction. Such
a creature might request something they personally want as
payment.
Critical Success The deity sends a servitor, and the servitor’s
payment costs only half as much as normal. If you ask for
a particular servitor by name, the deity is likely to send that
servitor unless the servitor is busy.
Success Your deity sends a servitor.
Failure Your deity does not send a servitor.
Critical Failure The deity is offended and sends a sign of

displeasure or possibly even a servitor to scold or attack you,
depending on your deity’s nature. A deity might also opt to
strip divine powers from its followers who participated until
they atone.
PLANT GROWTH RITUAL 4
UNCOMMON PLANT VITALITY WOOD
Cast 1 day; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Nature (expert); Secondary Checks Farming Lore
or Survival
Area 1/2-mile-radius circle centered on you
Duration 1 year
You cause the plants within the area to be healthier and more
fruitful. In addition to other benefits of healthy plants, this
increases the crop yield for farms, depending on your success.
If you cast it in the area of a blight, plant growth attempts to
counteract the blight instead of producing its usual effect.
Critical Success Double the crop yield in the area, or increase
the area to a 1-mile radius.
Success Increase the crop yield in the area by one-third.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure The flora in the area changes in an unanticipated
way, determined by the GM but generally as contradictory
to your true desires as possible (for instance, blighting crops
when you would prefer to enrich them).
PRIMAL CALL RITUAL 6
UNCOMMON
Cast 1 day; Cost faerie circle ingredients worth a total value of
1 gp × the spell rank × the target’s level; Secondary Casters 4
Primary Check Nature (master); Secondary Checks Crafting,
Diplomacy, Survival
Range 100 miles; Targets 1 animal, beast, fey, fungus, or plant
Duration see text
This functions as planar servitor except you craft a faerie
circle and call an animal, beast, fey, fungus, or plant from
within 100 miles.
RESURRECT RITUAL 5
UNCOMMON HEALING
Cast 1 day; Cost gemstones worth a total value of 75 gp × the
target’s level; Secondary Casters 2
Primary Check Religion (expert); Secondary Checks Medicine,
Society
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 dead creature of up to 10th level
You attempt to call forth the target’s soul and return it to its
body. This requires the target’s body to be present and relatively
intact. The target must have died within the past year. If
Pharasma has decided that the target’s time has come or the
target doesn’t wish to return, this ritual automatically fails, but
you discover this after the successful Religion check and can
end the ritual without paying the cost.
Critical Success You resurrect the target. They return to life
with full Hit Points and the same spells prepared and points
in their pools they had when they died, and still suffering
from any long-term debilitations of the old body. The target
meets an agent of their deity during the resurrection who
inspires them, granting them a +1 status bonus to attack rolls,
Perception, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 week. The
target is also permanently changed in some way by their time
in the afterlife, such as gaining a slight personality shift, a
streak of white in the hair, or a strange new birthmark.
Success As critical success, except the target returns to life
with 1 Hit Point and no spells prepared or points in any pools,
and still is affected by any long-term debilitations of the old
body. Instead of inspiring them, the character’s time in the
Boneyard has left them temporarily debilitated. The target
is clumsy 1, drained 1, and enfeebled 1 for 1 week; these
conditions can’t be removed or reduced by any means until
the week has passed.
Failure Your attempt is unsuccessful.
Critical Failure Something goes horribly wrong—an evil spirit
possesses the body, the body transforms into a special kind
of undead, or some worse fate befalls the target.
Heightened (6th) You can resurrect a target of up to 12th level,
and the base cost is 125 gp.
Heightened (7th) You can use resurrect even with only a small
portion of the body; the ritual creates a new body on a
success or critical success. The target must have died within
the past decade. The ritual requires four secondary casters,
each of whom must be at least half the target’s level. The
target can be up to 14th level, and the base cost is 200 gp.
Heightened (8th) As 7th rank, but the target can be up to 16th
level and the base cost is 300 gp.
Heightened (9th) You can use resurrect even without the body
as long as you know the target’s name and have touched a
portion of its body at any time. The target must have died
within the past century, and it doesn’t gain the negative
conditions on a success. The ritual requires eight secondary
casters, each of whom must be at least half the target’s level.
The target can be up to 18th level, and the base cost is 600 gp.
Heightened (10th) As 9th rank, except it doesn’t matter how
long ago the target died. The ritual requires 16 secondary
casters, each of whom must be at least half the target’s level.
The target can be up to 20th level, and the ritual’s base cost
is 1,000 gp.
RUNE TRAP RITUAL 3
UNCOMMON
Cast 1 hour; Cost pigments and oils worth a total value of 5 gp ×
the rank of the spell to be stored; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Arcana (expert), Nature (expert), Occultism
(expert), or Religion (expert) as determined by the tradition of
spell cast in the ritual; Secondary Checks Crafting
Range touch; Target 1 object or a 10-foot-by-10-foot area
You create a magical trap by binding a hostile spell into a rune.
As part of performing this ritual, you also Cast a Spell to store
in the rune. The stored spell must take 3 actions or fewer to
cast, have a hostile effect, and target one creature or have an
area. You can set a password, a trigger, or both for the rune. Any
creature that moves, opens, or touches the target container or
enters the target area that doesn’t speak the password or that

matches the trigger activates the rune, releasing the harmful
spell within.
Once a spell is stored in the rune, the rune gains all the traits
of that spell. If the stored spell targets one or more creatures, it
targets the creature that set off the rune. If it has an area, that
area is centered on the creature that set off the rune. The rune
is a magical trap, using your spell DC for both the Perception
check to notice it and the Thievery check to disable it; both
checks require the creature attempting them to be trained in
order to succeed. You can Dismiss the rune you create with this
ritual so long as you can see it.
Critical Success You create a particularly effective rune,
granting a +2 circumstance bonus to the DC to notice and
disable the rune.
Success You create the rune successfully.
Failure You fail to create the rune.
Critical Failure The rune backfires, dealing 4d6 force damage
per rank of the rune’s spell to you, the secondary caster, and
all creatures within 10 feet of the ritual’s area.
WISH RITUAL 10
RARE
Cast 1 day; Cost fine ash, magically imbued pigments, and a
gem in a marquise cut worth 100,000 gp in total; Secondary
Casters 2
Primary Check Arcana (legendary), Nature (legendary),
Occultism (legendary), Religion (legendary); Secondary
Checks Crafting, Diplomacy
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 creature
You weave the fabric of reality itself to grant the target’s
greatest desire. The target declares their wish in a loud voice at
the start of the ritual and again at the end. The target’s wish can
be anything, ranging from simpler wishes such as vast riches or
the casting of a certain spell or ritual, to greater wishes like the
destruction of an entire kingdom or ascension to divinity. The
GM might decide a wish draws the attention of deities or other
powerful creatures, leading to interference with the ritual or
attempts to undo the wish. The power of the ritual alters reality
to such a degree that even deities can’t outright undo the wish,
but they can react to the wish by sending servitors to take away
the newly acquired riches, for example.
Critical Success The wish is granted without complication or
drawbacks.
Success The wish is granted, but with unintended consequences
or side effects, such as taking riches from a well-known
criminal, stirring a damaged kingdom to war, or angering
rival gods.
Failure The wish fails and has no result. The GM can instead
have the wish be partially granted, but to such a lesser
degree that the target will be eternally unsatisfied.
Critical Failure The wish is corrupted, resulting in a cruel
fulfillment. The GM determines the full results, but the
outcome is generally ironic in some nature, such as becoming
trapped in an underground vault full of riches, being
transported to the kingdom as it’s destroyed, or achieving
divinity within an inaccessible demiplane.
